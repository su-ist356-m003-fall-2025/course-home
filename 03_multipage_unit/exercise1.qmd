title: "Exercise 1: Practice with `git` on a local repository"
index: 2
---

In this exercise you will initialize a git repository on your computer and explore various git commands with it.

### Part 1: Initializing and adding files

1. Go to your home directory by typing:

    ``` bash
    cd
    ```

2. Create a directory called `test-git-repo` and `cd` into it:

    ``` bash
    mkdir test-git-repo
    cd test-git-repo
    ```

3. At the moment, `test-git-repo` is just a normal directory, like any others. We want to turn this into a git repository and track changes to files made in this directory. To do that, run:

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

    *Note that you have to run this from within the directory you want to turn into a repository.*

4. `test-git-repo` is now tracked by `git`. Run:

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

    to see what the status of the repo is. You should get:

    ```bash
    On branch main

    No commits yet

    nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
    ```

5. Let's add some files for git to track. Use your favorite text editor to create a file called `story.txt` and add the following to it:

    ```bash
    Once upon a time, in a land far,
    far away...
    ```

    Save and exit the file, then type `ls` to verify it's there. Now run

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

    again. You should have:

    ```bash
    On branch main

    No commits yet

    Untracked files:
      (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        story.txt

    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
    ```

    git knows you have a file in the directory called `story.txt`, but it isn't tracked by git yet!

6. Tell git to start tracking `story.txt` by using `git add`. Run the following:

    ```bash
    git add story.txt
    ```

    Now type `git status`. You'll see:
    
    ```bash
    On branch main

    No commits yet

    Changes to be committed:
      (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   story.txt
    ```
    
    Notice that it still says there are no commits, but that on the next commit the file `story.txt` will be added. This means that `story.txt` is *staged* for the next commit.

7. Commit the change by running:

    ```bash
    git commit -m "add story idea"
    ```
    
    Now run `git status`. You should get `nothing to commit, working tree clean`. Congratulations, you've made your first commit! To verify, run:
    
    ```bash
    git log
    ```
    
    to see the history of your commits. Since this is your first commit, there will only be one entry.

### Part 2: Making changes to files

1. You're not happy with your story opening. You don't want to write fairy tales, you want to write SciFi! Use your favorite text editor to open `story.txt` and change the line `Once upon a time, in a land far,` to `A long time ago in a galaxy far,` so that your file now reads:

    ```bash
    A long time ago in a galaxy far,
    far away...
    ```
    
    Much better. Now type `git status`; you should see:
    
    ```bash
    On branch main
    Changes not staged for commit:
      (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
      (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   story.txt

    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
    ```
    
    git recognizes that `story.txt` has changed, but your changes have not been committed yet. You can see how the file differs from the last commit you did by typing:
    
    ```bash
    git diff
    ```

2. Let's commit your changes so you don't lose them! We'll stage the changes by running `git add` again:

    ```bash
    git add story.txt
    ```

    (Alternatively, you can just run `git add -u` to stage changes to all tracked files that have changed.) Now we'll commit the change, however, we'll do it slightly differently than we did above. Just run:
    
    ```bash
    git commit
    ```
    
    (i.e., don't include the `-m` argument). This will cause a text editor to open. The text editor that is used depends on your `git` settings. Since we set git's global `core.editor` to `nano` in the [intro](index.qmd#git-configuration), nano will open up for you. Now you can type in a commit message. Type "change opening" then save by hitting `<Ctrl>+O`. When nano asks where to save to, just hit `<Enter>` to save to the default. Then hit `<Ctrl>+X` to exit. This will complete the commit; you will be returned to the command line. To verify that the commit worked, run:
    
    ```bash
    git log
    ```
    
    You'll now see 2 commits in your history.

::: {.callout-note}
Note that there are two different ways to provide a commit message:

 1. Provide the `-m` argument along with a short message in quotes when you run `git commit` on the command line, like we did in Part 1, step 7 above; i.e, run:
    
    ``` bash
    git commit -m "YOUR MESSAGE"
    ```

    In that case, the commit will be completed on the command line; no text editor will be opened.

 2. Do not provide the `-m` argument. In that case, a text editor will open with which you can type the commit message. The commit will be created as soon as you save and exit from the editor. Note that if you exit the editor without saving, the commit will not be created. (You will be returned to the command line with the file changes still in the staged state.)

Either way is fine. Typically the second method is used if you want to write a more elaborate commit message that spans multiple lines, which is difficult to do on the command line.
:::

### Part 3: Branches

You want to start working on titles for your stories, but you want to do it independently of your work on the story itself. To do that, let's create a branch to specifically work on titles.

1. Run `git branch`. You should get back:
    
    ```bash
    * main
    ```
    
    This means there is currently only one branch, called `main`. The `*` next to `main` means that you are currently on the main branch. Let's create a new branch for working on the titles. Run:
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b title-dev
    ```
    
    You'll get `Switched to a new branch 'title-dev'`. To verify, run `git branch` again. Now you should see:
    
    ```bash
      main
    * title-dev
    ```
    
    Notice that `story.txt` is still here (type `ls`) and that your git history is the same as before (type `git log`). This is because when you create a branch, the branch will have all the same history and files as the main branch.

2. Let's create a file to store our title idea. Use your favorite text editor to create a file called `title.txt` and put in it:
    
    ```bash
    STAR FIGHT!
    ```
    
    (You can also use `echo` and the `>` operator on the command line to do this.) The title's not great, but you can't think of anything better at the moment.

3. Now that you've created the file, run `git status`; you should see that `title.txt` is untracked. Add it to be tracked and commit:
    
    ```bash
    git add title.txt
    git commit -m "add title idea"
    ```
    
    Now type `git log`; you'll see you have 3 commits in your history.

4. Satisfied with your title for now, go back to your main branch to work on your story some more. Switch back to the `main` branch by running:
    
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```
    
    (Notice that we don't include the `-b` flag this time. This is because `main` already exists; we only add the `-b` when we want to create a new branch.) Verify that you're on main by running `git branch`; you should get:
    
    ```bash
    * main
      title-dev
    ```
    
    Note that the `*` is now next to main. 

    Now type `ls`. The `title.txt` file is gone! To see why, type `git log`. Your last commit is no longer in your history; you just have the first two commits. This is because your last commit (and the file it created, `title.txt`) only exists on the `title-dev` branch. To verify that it's still there, you check the history of the `title-dev` branch by running:
    
    ```bash
    git log title-dev
    ```
    
    In graph form, your repository currently looks like this:

    ![](figures/git_graphs.001.png){height=300}

    Here, each dot represents a commit, and the different lines represent a different branch. Following a line illustrates the history as seen by that branch. Since the commits on title-dev live on their own branch, changes you make on `main` won't affect `title-dev` and vice versa (at least not until we merge the branches; more on that below).

::: {.callout-tip}
You can git graphs like the above in your terminal if you add `--graph` to the `git log` command; i.e.

```bash
git log --graph
```
:::

5. Let's make some more changes to `story.txt`. Use your favorite text editor to open `story.txt` and add the following lines:

    ```bash

    It is period of civil war.
    Rebel spaceships, striking
    from a hidden base, have won
    their first victory against
    the evil Galactic Empire.
    ```
    
    Stage the change and commit it:
    
    ```bash
    git add -u
    git commit -m "add intro paragraph"
    ```
    
    Now type `git log`: you should have 3 commits, none of which include the commits to `title-dev` branch.

7. In a flash of brilliance, you get an idea for the title of your story. Quick! Switch to your `title-dev` branch by typing:

    ```bash
    git checkout title-dev
    ```
    
    You can verify that you're on the `title-dev` branch by typing `git branch`. Now use your favorite text editor to open `title.txt` and change `STAR FIGHT!` to:
    
    ```bash
    Star Wars
    A NEW HOPE

    by
    George Lucas
    ```
    
    Nice work, George! Now save and exit. Stage the change and commit it:
    
    ```bash
    git add -u
    git commit -m "update title"
    ```
    
    Type `git log` to check your history. Note that there are 4 commits here: the first two from `main` (before you branched off), and the last two on `title-dev`. In graph form, your repo looks like this:

    ![](figures/git_graphs.002.png){height=300}

8. Satisfied that your title is perfect, you no longer feel the need to keep the title development on a separate branch. It's ready to be *merged* on to the `main` branch. To do that, switch to the main branch:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```
    
    and merge in the changes on `title-dev` by typing:
    
    ```bash
    git merge title-dev
    ```
    
    This will open up your text editor (which we set to `nano` in the intro). Don't change the commit message, just save and exit to return to your terminal.

    Now type `git log`. You should see 6 commits: the initial two commits on main, the first commit on title-dev, the add paragraph commit on main, and the update title commit you made on title-dev, followed by an additional "Merge" commit. This final "merge" commit is to indicate that some of the commits in the history came from another branch (and what the name of the branch was).

    If you type:
    
    ```bash
    ls
    ```
    
    you'll see that both `story.txt` and `title.txt` are in your directory (on the main branch), and if you look in them, you'll see the most up-to-date versions of both. In graph form, your main branch now looks like:

    ![](figures/git_graphs.003.png){height=300}

::: {.callout-note}
There is another way to merge branches called *rebasing*. Rebasing changes the history of the development branch to make it look like all the commits came after the last commit on main. This makes for a cleaner history when merging, but can be more challenging to do correctly. See the Appendix (below) for more information.
:::

9. Now that you've merged your `title-dev` branch, you can delete it to save space. To do that, run:

    ```bash
    git branch -d title-dev
    ```

::: {.callout-note}
If you had not merged everything on `title-dev` into `main`, you would have gotten an error preventing you from deleting the branch. The fact that you could delete it gives you confidence that everything on the development branch has been merged.

### Challenge Questions: Editing the same file on different branches

In the above example we only made changes to different files on our two branches: on `main` we only edited `story.txt`, while on `title-dev` we only edited `title.txt`. However, there is nothing stopping us from editing the *same* file concurrently on two different branches. The following questions will illustrate how that works.

:::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon="false"}
#### Question 1: Setup

Create a file called `list.txt` that initially contains the following three lines:

```bash
alpha
bravo
charlie
```

Now use the `git` commands you learned above to do the following:

1. Add and commit `list.txt` to `main`.

2. Create a branch called `dev1`.

3. On `dev1` change the first line of `list.txt` to `delta` then commit the change.

4. Go back to `main` and change the third line to `foxtrot`, then commit it.


::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
##### Solution

1. Run:
    
    ```bash
    git add list.txt
    git commit -m "add list.txt"
    ```

2. Run:
    
    ```bash
    git checkout -b dev1
    ```

3. Use `nano` (or your favorite text editor) to edit `list.txt` and change the first line to `delta`. Then run:

    ```bash
    git add list.txt
    git commit -m "change the first item of list"
    ```

4. First run:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```

    Then use `nano` (or your favorite text editor) to edit `list.txt` and  change the third line to `foxtrot`. To commit, run:

    ```bash
    git add list.txt
    git commit -m "change the last item of list"
    ```


:::

When you are done, `list.txt` should look like the following on `main`:

```bash
alpha
bravo
foxtrot
```

while on `dev1` it should look like:

```bash
delta
bravo
charlie
```

You can check the differences by running `git diff main dev1.`

::::


:::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon="false"}
#### Question 2: Editing different lines

Now suppose you merge `dev1` into `main`. What happens to `list.txt`?

**A.** `main` takes precedence since it's the branch being merged into; `list.txt` will look like:

```txt
alpha
bravo
foxtrot
```

**B.** `dev1` takes precedence since it's the branch being merged; `list.txt` will look like:

```txt
delta
bravo
charlie
```

**C.** The changes from both are adopted; `list.txt` will look like:

```txt
delta
bravo
foxtrot
```

**D.** An error is raised because the same file was modified.

*If you're not sure, try it yourself and see what happens!*


::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
##### Solution

The answer is **C**. Since different lines have been modified, `git` is able to merge the changes together without issue. To do it yourself, run:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge dev1
```
:::
::::

:::: {.callout-caution appearance="simple" icon="false"}
#### Question 3: Editing the same lines

After merging `dev1` on to `main`, suppose you create another branch called `dev2`. On `dev2` you change the second line of `list.txt` to be `echo` while on `main` you change the second line to `easy`; i.e. on `main` `list.txt` looks like:

```txt
delta
easy
foxtrot
```

On `dev2` `list.txt` looks like:

```txt
delta
echo
foxtrot
```

**What happens if you merge `dev2` into `main` in this case?**

**A.** `main` takes precedence since it's the branch being merged into; `list.txt` will look like:
    
```txt
delta
easy
foxtrot
```

**B.** `dev2` takes precedence since it's the branch being merged; `list.txt` will look like:

```txt
delta
echo
foxtrot
```

**C.** The changes from both branches are adopted; `list.txt` will look like:

```txt
delta
easy
echo
foxtrot
```

**D.** An error is raised because the same line is modified.


::: {.callout-caution collapse="true" appearance="simple" icon="false"}
##### Solution

The answer is **D**, an error is raised. Since the same line has been modified in the same file, `git` cannot tell how to reconcile the differences. This is known as a *merge conflict*. In this case, `git` will leave it up to the user to reconcile the differences. How to do that is discussed in the next section. 

:::
::::

### Part 4: Resolving merge conflicts

As illustrated in the Challenge Questions, if the same lines in the same file are modified on two different branches, `git` will not know how to merge the changes. This is called a **merge conflict**. In this case, `git` will ask you to reconcile the differences. To illustrate, let's try merging `dev2` into `main` after making the changes to `list.txt` discussed in Question 3 above:

1. If you have not done so, try to merge `dev2` into `main` after making the changes to the second line of `list.txt` discussed in Question 3:

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git merge dev2
    ```

    You should get the following:

    ```txt
    Auto-merging list.txt
    CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in list.txt
    Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
    ```

2. To resolve the merge conflict, we must edit `list.txt` ourselves. Use `nano` (or your favorite text editor) to open `list.txt`. You should see the following:

    ```txt
    delta
    <<<<<<< HEAD
    easy
    =======
    echo
    >>>>>>> dev2
    foxtrot
    ```

    `git` has added the conflicting lines from both branches to the file, along with information about the two branches. The line as it appears on `main` is prefaced with `<<<<<<< HEAD`. This indicates that the following line(s) is (are) how it appears on the branch being merged into. The line(s) is (are) followed by a `=======`.

    After the `=======` the line(s) as it/they appear(s) on the branch being merged are shown. These are followed by `>>>>>>> BRANCH_NAME` (here, `BRANCH_NAME` is `dev2`).

3. We are free to edit the file anyway we like to resolve the conflict. You should remove the `<<<<`, `====`, and `>>>>` lines that `git` has added, along with the edit you want to make to resolve the conflict.

    In this case, let's keep the edit as it appears on `dev2`, and remove the edit on `main`. Delete the appropriate lines so that the file looks like:

    ```txt
    delta
    echo
    foxtrot
    ```

    Then save and exit the file.

4. Now that we are happy with the way `list.txt` appears, add the file:

    ```bash
    git add list.txt
    ```

    Now `commit` *without the* `-m`:

    ```bash
    git commit
    ```

    This will open up your text editor. The commit message will already be set to `Merge branch 'dev2'`. While you are free to modify this, it's usually best to leave it as-is, as it indicates the merge. Save and exit the file.

5. The merge conflict is resolved! If you type `git log` you will see the history with all the commits in it, as if you had a merged without any issue.

Merge conflicts happen, but can be fixed fairly easy. If there were multiple areas in a file that caused a conflict, the conflicting areas would all be surrounded by the same `<<<<<<< `/`=======`/`>>>>>>>` lines that we saw above. You'll want to search through the file for those to make sure you got all the conflicts. If multiple files had conflicts, `git` will make you resolve all of them before allowing the merge to complete.

### Summary

That's the basics of how to use `git`. In the following parts we'll see how to use this with GitHub and how to collaborate with partners using `git` and GitHub.

### Appendix: Rebasing

Before merging `title-dev` into master in step 8 above, we could have first done a *rebase*. If you rebase a development branch against its parent branch (in this case `main`) it will incorporate all the commits that were made on the parent after the development branch was originally created. To do so, the development branch's history is rearranged so that the additional commits from the parent are placed before all commits that were made on the development branch.

For example, if we had run `git rebase main` while on the `title-dev` branch in Part 3, step 8 above, `title-dev`'s history would have been rearranged from:

![](figures/git_graphs.002.png){height=300}

to:

![](figures/git_graphs.004.png){height=300}

The **advantage** to rebasing is that when we merge a rebased development branch back into main no "Merge" commit is created, and the history on main is much simpler. So, in our story example, if we had done the following in step 8:

```bash
git checkout title-dev
git rebase main
git checkout main
git merge title-dev
```

Then main's history would have looked like:

![](figures/git_graphs.005.png){height=250}

rather than the more complicated graph above.

The **disadvantage** to rebasing is it can be more challenging to handle merge conflicts. When rebasing, conflicts need to be handled at the point they are created in the development branch, rather once at the end when the merge occurs. If resolving a conflict affects a later commit on the development branch, it can cause a cascading series of conflicts that can be a challenge to untangle. The other challenge with rebasing is it can cause issues when collaborating with others on a development branch. Since rebasing changes the history of the branch, it can make it a challenge for your colleagues to keep their clones in sync with yours. For these reasons, rebasing is best for more advanced users.

For more on rebasing, see this article by the Atlassian corporation: [Merging vs. rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing).
