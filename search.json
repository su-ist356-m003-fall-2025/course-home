    "text": "Course Requirements and Expectations\n\nAttendance and Participation\nIn-class participation is the best way to learn and absorb the material. As such, you are expected to attend and participate in every class session. Your grade will be partially based on attendance (see below for details). If you must miss class, you are responsible for making up the work and catching up on what you missed. Lectures will be recorded and posted to the course website after the class.\n\n\nAssignments\nThe assignments are programming / problem solving activities that you will complete outside of class. The assignment due dates are posted on the course schedule. Consider these assignments formative assessments - practice so you can get better at computational thinking, problem solving and writing code. It is important to reflect upon your work and take an honest assessment of your abilities as you complete each assignment.\nEach Wednesday we will review the homework assignment. Students will be asked to contribute to the discussion.\nFactors affecting your grade:\n\nIs the code working and correct?\nWere the instructions followed? (e.g. commit after each function is written)\nGood reflection: specific, uses terminology, actionable\nHanded in on time, so your prof only needs to review submissions 1 time.\n\n\n\nExams\nExams are summative assessments. They are designed to test your knowledge of the material. The exams will be issued in class on the dates posted on the course schedule. Exams are closed-book but you may bring one 8.5x11 sheet of paper with your notes on it. Exams length is 60 minutes. They will be a mix of mix of multiple choice, short answer and code tracing and code writing.\n\n\nProject\nThe project is your opportunity to demonstrate what you have learned in an experiential fashion. In your final project you will be expected to create a data pipeline of your choosing.\n\nThe pipeline should incorporate techniques we learned in the course and the more techniques you incorporate correctly the higher your grade.\nIt is expected that you will be able to explain your choices, and they will be appropriate for the problem.\nThe pipeline should be first written exploratory, and then refactored into a production quality pipeline. Both pipelines should be submitted.\nThere should be a simple data visualization or dashboard from the pipeline output as to demonstrate its usefulness.",

    "section": "The prompt",
    "text": "The prompt\nWhen the shell is first opened, you are presented with a prompt, indicating that the shell is waiting for input.\n$\nThe shell typically uses $ as the prompt, but may use a different symbol. In the examples for this lesson, we’ll show the prompt as $. Most importantly, do not type the prompt when typing commands. Only type the command that follows the prompt. This rule applies both in these lessons and in lessons from other sources. Also note that after you type a command, you have to press the Enter key to execute it.\nThe prompt is followed by a text cursor, a character that indicates the position where your typing will appear. The cursor is usually a flashing or solid block, but it can also be an underscore or a pipe. You may have seen it in a text editor program, for example.\nNote that your prompt might look a little different. In particular, most popular shell environments by default put your user name and the host name before the $. Such a prompt might look like, e.g.:\ncdcapano@localhost $\nThe prompt might even include more than this. Do not worry if your prompt is not just a short $. This lesson does not depend on this additional information and it should also not get in your way. The only important item to focus on is the $ character itself and we will see later why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoneOPTIONAL: Change your prompt to $\n\n\n\nIf you’d like to simplify your prompt for the purposes of this tutorial, copy and paste the code below into your terminal:\nPS1='$ '\n\n\nSo let’s try our first command, ls, which is short for listing. This command will list the contents of the current directory:\n$ ls\nDesktop     Downloads   Movies      Pictures\nDocuments   Library     Music       Public\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipCommand not found\n\n\n\nIf the shell can’t find a program whose name is the command you typed, it will print an error message such as:\n$ ks\nks: command not found\nThis might happen if the command was mis-typed or if the program corresponding to that command is not installed.\n\n\n\nA Typical Problem\nYou are a marine biologist who has just returned from a six-month survey of the North Pacific Gyre, where you have sampled gelatinous marine life in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. You have 1520 samples that you’ve run through an assay machine to measure the relative abundance of 300 proteins. You need to run these 1520 files through an imaginary program called goostats.sh. In addition to this huge task, you have to write up results by the end of the month, so your paper can appear in a special issue of Aquatic Goo Letters.\nIf you choose to run goostats.sh by hand using a GUI, you’ll have to select and open a file 1520 times. If goostats.sh takes 30 seconds to run each file, the whole process will take more than 12 hours. With the shell, you can instead assign your computer this mundane task while you focuses her attention on writing your paper.\nThe next few lessons will explore the ways you can achieve this. More specifically, the lessons explain how you can use a command shell to run the goostats.sh program, using loops to automate the repetitive steps of entering file names, so that your computer can work while you write your paper.\nAs a bonus, once you have put a processing pipeline together, you will be able to use it again whenever you collect more data.\nIn order to achieve your task, you need to know how to:\n\nnavigate to a file/directory\ncreate a file/directory\ncheck the length of a file\nchain commands together\nretrieve a set of files\niterate over files\nrun a shell script containing your pipeline\n\nDownload files:\nYou need to download some files to follow this lesson.\n\nDownload shell-lesson-data.zip and move the file to your Desktop.\nUnzip/extract the file. Let your instructor know if you need help with this step. You should end up with a new folder called shell-lesson-data on your Desktop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Points\n\n\n\n\nA shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.\nThis lesson uses Bash, the default shell in many implementations of Unix.\nPrograms can be run in Bash by entering commands at the command-line prompt.\nThe shell’s main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and its capacity to access networked machines.\nA significant challenge when using the shell can be knowing what commands need to be run and how to run them.",

    "section": "Where am I?",
    "text": "Where am I?\nFirst, let’s find out where we are by running a command called pwd (which stands for ‘print working directory’). Directories are like places — at any time while we are using the shell, we are in exactly one place called our current working directory. Commands mostly read and write files in the current working directory, i.e. ‘here’, so knowing where you are before running a command is important. pwd shows you where you are:\n$ pwd\n/Users/cdcapano\nThe computer’s response is /Users/cdcapano, which is my home directory.\n\nThe home directory\nThe home directory will look different on different operating systems.\n\nLinux: /home/cdcapano\nWindows: C:\\Users\\cdcapano (This may differ based on Windows versions)\n\nIf pwd returns something else, you may need to navigate to your home directory using the command cd.\nLet’s look at how a filesystem is organized:\n\nThe filesystem looks like an upside-down tree. We refer to the topmost directory as the “root directory”. It contains everything else. It is referred to with the / symbol.\nIn this illustration, we have several other directories stemming off of the root. The bin directory often refers to a location where programs are stored. tmp is a common directory on filesystems as a place to hold files that don’t need to be kept long-term. You may recognize the Users directory from the output we had above when typing pwd. We know the path of our home directory, where we currently are, is /Users/cdcapano.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipSlashes\n\n\n\nThere are two meanings for the / character. When it appears at the front of a path, it means “root”, when it appears within a path, it acts as a separator.\n\n\n\nThe Users folder may have more than one directory in it. For example, the image below depicts two users, cdcapano and aturing. The home directory just as the home directory for cdcapano is /Users/cdcapano, the home directory for aturing would be /Users/aturing. Typically, when you open a new command prompt, you will start in your home directory by default",

It will be read many times and typed once.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipUnsupported commandline options\n\n\n\nIf you try to use an option that is not supported, ls and other commands will usually print an error message similar to:\n$ ls -j\nMac zsh output:\nls: invalid option -- j\nusage: ls [-@ABCFGHILOPRSTUWXabcdefghiklmnopqrstuvwxy1%,] [--color=when] [-D format] [file ...]\nother Unix output:\nls: invalid option -- 'j'\nTry 'ls --help' for more information.\n\n\n\nChallenge Questions\nExplore the ls command options to answer the following questions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 1: Listing in long, human-readable format\n\n\n\nWhich options for ls produces output in long format that is human readable? (i.e. displaying something like 5.3K instead of 5369)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nthe options -l and -h can be used with ls to make the output long and human readable. You can use them in two ways:\n\nls -l -h\nor string them together ls -lh\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 2: Listing in Reverse Chronological Order\n\n\n\nBy default, ls lists the contents of a directory in alphabetical order by name. The command ls -t lists items by time of last change instead of alphabetically. The command ls -r lists the contents of a directory in reverse order. Which file is displayed last when you combine the -t and -r options? Hint: You may need to use the -l option to see the last changed dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most recently changed file is listed last when using -rt. This can be very useful for finding your most recent edits or checking to see if a new output file was written.",

    "text": "Exploring other directories\nNot only can we use ls on the current working directory, but we can use it to list the contents of a different directory. Let’s take a look at our Desktop directory by running ls -F Desktop, i.e., the command ls with the -F option and the argument Desktop. The argument Desktop tells ls that we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:\n$ ls -F Desktop\nYou should see your newly created directory “workshop”\nshell-lesson-data/\nNote that if a directory named Desktop does not exist in your current working directory, this command will return an error. Typically, a Desktop directory exists in your home directory, which we assume is the current working directory of your bash shell.\nYour output should be a list of all the files and sub-directories in your Desktop directory, including the shell-lesson-data directory you downloaded at the setup for this lesson. (On most systems, the contents of the Desktop directory in the shell will show up as icons in a graphical user interface behind all the open windows. See if this is the case for you.)\nOrganizing things hierarchically helps us keep track of our work. While it’s possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory just as it’s possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk, it’s much easier to find things when they’ve been organized into sensibly-named subdirectories.\nNow that we know the shell-lesson-data directory is located in our Desktop directory, we can do two things.\nFirst, using the same strategy as before, we can look at its contents by passing a directory name to ls:\n$ ls -F Desktop/shell-lesson-data\nexercise-data/  north-pacific-gyre/\nSecond, we can actually change our location to a different directory, so we are no longer located in our home directory.\nThe command to change locations is cd followed by a directory name to change our working directory. cd stands for ‘change directory’, which is a bit misleading. The command doesn’t change the directory; it changes the shell’s current working directory. In other words it changes the shell’s settings for what directory we are in. The cd command is akin to double-clicking a folder in a graphical interface to get into that folder.\nLet’s say we want to move into the exercise-data directory we saw above. We can use the following series of commands to get there:\n$ cd Desktop\n$ cd shell-lesson-data\n$ cd exercise-data\nThese commands will move us from our home directory into our Desktop directory, then into the shell-lesson-data directory, then into the exercise-data directory. You will notice that cd doesn’t print anything. This is normal. Many shell commands will not output anything to the screen when successfully executed. But if we run pwd after it, we can see that we are now in /Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data.\nIf we run ls -F without arguments now, it lists the contents of /Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data, because that’s where we now are:\n$ pwd\n/Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data\n$ ls -F\nalkanes/  animal-counts/  creatures/  numbers.txt  writing/\nWe now know how to go down the directory tree (i.e. how to go into a subdirectory), but how do we go up (i.e. how do we leave a directory and go into its parent directory)? We might try the following:\n$ cd shell-lesson-data\n-bash: cd: shell-lesson-data: No such file or directory\nBut we get an error! Why is this?\nWith our methods so far, cd can only see sub-directories inside your current directory. There are different ways to see directories above your current location; we’ll start with the simplest.\nThere is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level. It works as follows:\n$ cd ..\n.. is a special directory name meaning “the directory containing this one”, or more succinctly, the parent of the current directory. Sure enough, if we run pwd after running cd .., we’re back in /Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data:\n$ pwd\n/Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data\nThe special directory .. doesn’t usually show up when we run ls. If we want to display it, we can add the -a option to ls -F:\n$ ls -F -a\n./  ../  exercise-data/  north-pacific-gyre/\n-a stands for ‘show all’ (including hidden files); it forces ls to show us file and directory names that begin with ., such as .. (which, if we’re in /Users/cdcapano, refers to the /Users directory). As you can see, it also displays another special directory that’s just called ., which means ‘the current working directory’. It may seem redundant to have a name for it, but we’ll see some uses for it soon.\nNote that in most command line tools, multiple options can be combined with a single - and no spaces between the options; ls -F -a is equivalent to ls -Fa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteOther Hidden Files\n\n\n\nIn addition to the hidden directories .. and ., you may also see a file called .bash_profile. This file usually contains shell configuration settings. You may also see other files and directories beginning with .. These are usually files and directories that are used to configure different programs on your computer. The prefix . is used to prevent these configuration files from cluttering the terminal when a standard ls command is used.\n\n\nThese three commands are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer: pwd, ls, and cd. Let’s explore some variations on those commands. What happens if you type cd on its own, without giving a directory?\n$ cd\nHow can you check what happened? pwd gives us the answer!\n$ pwd\n/Users/cdcapano\nIt turns out that cd without an argument will return you to your home directory, which is great if you’ve got lost in your own filesystem.\nLet’s try returning to the exercise-data directory from before. Last time, we used three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories to move to exercise-data in one step:\n$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data\nCheck that we’ve moved to the right place by running pwd and ls -F.\nIf we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use cd ... But there is another way to move to any directory, regardless of your current location.\nSo far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above), we have been using relative paths. When you use a relative path with a command like ls or cd, it tries to find that location from where we are, rather than from the root of the file system.\nHowever, it is possible to specify the absolute path to a directory by including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a leading slash. The leading / tells the computer to follow the path from the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory, no matter where we are when we run the command.\nThis allows us to move to our shell-lesson-data directory from anywhere on the filesystem (including from inside exercise-data). To find the absolute path we’re looking for, we can use pwd and then extract the piece we need to move to shell-lesson-data.\n$ pwd\n/Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data\n$ cd /Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data\nRun pwd and ls -F to ensure that we’re in the directory we expect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipTwo more shortcuts\n\n\n\nThe shell interprets a tilde (~) character at the start of a path to mean “the current user’s home directory”. For example, if your home directory is /Users/cdcapano, then ~/data is equivalent to /Users/cdcapano/data. This only works if it is the first character in the path; here/there/~/elsewhere is not here/there/Users/cdcapano/elsewhere.\nAnother shortcut is the - (dash) character. cd will translate - into the previous directory I was in, which is faster than having to remember, then type, the full path. This is a very efficient way of moving back and forth between two directories – i.e. if you execute cd - twice, you end up back in the starting directory.\nThe difference between cd .. and cd - is that the former brings you up, while the latter brings you back.\n\nTry it!\nFirst navigate to ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data (you should already be there).\n$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data\nThen cd into the exercise-data/creatures directory\n$ cd exercise-data/creatures\nNow if you run\n$ cd -\nyou’ll see you’re back in ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data. Run cd - again and you’re back in ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/creatures\n\n\n\n\nChallenge Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 3: Absolute vs Relative Paths\n\n\n\nStarting from /Users/cdcapano/data, which of the following commands could cdcapano use to navigate to her home directory, which is /Users/cdcapano?\n\ncd .\ncd /\ncd /home/cdcapano\ncd ../..\ncd ~\ncd home\ncd ~/data/..\ncd\ncd ..\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo: . stands for the current directory.\nNo: / stands for the root directory.\nNo: cdcapano’s home directory is /Users/cdcapano.\nNo: this command goes up two levels, i.e. ends in /Users.\nYes: ~ stands for the user’s home directory, in this case /Users/cdcapano.\nNo: this command would navigate into a directory home in the current directory if it exists.\nYes: unnecessarily complicated, but correct.\nYes: shortcut to go back to the user’s home directory.\nYes: goes up one level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 4: Relative Path Resolution\n\n\n\nUsing the filesystem diagram below, if pwd displays /Users/thing, what will ls -F ../backup display?\n\n\n../backup: No such file or directory\n2012-12-01 2013-01-08 2013-01-27\n2012-12-01/ 2013-01-08/ 2013-01-27/\noriginal/ pnas_final/ pnas_sub/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo: there is a directory backup in /Users.\nNo: this is the content of Users/thing/backup, but with .., we asked for one level further up.\nNo: see previous explanation.\nYes: ../backup/ refers to /Users/backup/.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionQuestion 5: ls reading comprehension\n\n\n\nUsing the filesystem diagram below, if pwd displays /Users/backup, and -r tells ls to display things in reverse order, what command(s) will result in the following output:\npnas_sub/ pnas_final/ original/\n\n\nls pwd\nls -r -F\nls -r -F /Users/backup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo: pwd is not the name of a directory.\nYes: ls without directory argument lists files and directories in the current directory.\nYes: uses the absolute path explicitly.",

    "section": "General Syntax of a Shell Command",
    "text": "General Syntax of a Shell Command\nWe have now encountered commands, options, and arguments, but it is perhaps useful to formalise some terminology.\nConsider the command below as a general example of a command, which we will dissect into its component parts:\n$ ls -F /\n\nls is the command, with an option -F and an argument /. We’ve already encountered options which either start with a single dash (-), known as short options, or two dashes (--), known as long options. Options change the behavior of a command and arguments tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories). Sometimes options and arguments are referred to as parameters. A command can be called with more than one option and more than one argument, but a command doesn’t always require an argument or an option.\nYou might sometimes see options being referred to as switches or flags, especially for options that take no argument. In this lesson we will stick with using the term option.\nEach part is separated by spaces. If you omit the space between ls and -F the shell will look for a command called ls-F, which doesn’t exist. Also, capitalization can be important. For example, ls -s will display the size of files and directories alongside the names, while ls -S will sort the files and directories by size, as shown below:\n$ cd ~/Desktop/shell-lesson-data\n$ ls -s exercise-data\ntotal 28\n 4 animal-counts   4 creatures  12 numbers.txt   4 alkanes   4 writing\nNote that the sizes returned by ls -s are in blocks. As these are defined differently for different operating systems, you may not obtain the same figures as in the example.\n$ ls -S exercise-data\nanimal-counts  creatures  alkanes  writing  numbers.txt\nPutting all that together, our command ls -F / above gives us a listing of files and directories in the root directory /. An example of the output you might get from the above command is given below:\n$ ls -F /\nApplications/         System/\nLibrary/              Users/\nNetwork/              Volumes/\n\nYour Task: Organizing Files\nKnowing this much about files and directories, You are ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.\nYou create a directory called north-pacific-gyre (to remind yourself where the data came from), which will contain the data files from the assay machine and your data processing scripts.\nEach of your physical samples is labelled according to your lab’s convention with a unique ten-character ID, such as ‘NENE01729A’. This ID is what you used in your collection log to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample, so you decide to use it within the filename of each data file. Since the output of the assay machine is plain text, you will call your files NENE01729A.txt, NENE01812A.txt, and so on. All 1520 files will go into the same directory.\nNow in your current directory shell-lesson-data, you can see what files you have using the command:\n$ ls north-pacific-gyre/\nThis command is a lot to type, but you can let the shell do most of the work through what is called tab completion. If you types:\n$ ls nor\nand then presses Tab (the tab key on her keyboard), the shell automatically completes the directory name for you:\n$ ls north-pacific-gyre/\nPressing Tab again does nothing, since there are multiple possibilities; pressing Tab twice brings up a list of all the files.\nIf you then presses G and then presses Tab again, the shell will append ‘goo’ since all files that start with ‘g’ share the first three characters ‘goo’.\n$ ls north-pacific-gyre/goo\nTo see all of those files, you can press Tab twice more.\nls north-pacific-gyre/goo\ngoodiff.sh   goostats.sh\nThis is called tab completion, and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Points\n\n\n\n\nThe file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.\nInformation is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).\nDirectories can also store other directories, which then form a directory tree.\npwd prints the user’s current working directory.\nls [path] prints a listing of a specific file or directory; ls on its own lists the current working directory.\ncd [path] changes the current working directory.\nMost commands take options that begin with a single -.\nDirectory names in a path are separated with / on Unix, but \\ on Windows.\n/ on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.\nAn absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.\nA relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.\n. on its own means ‘the current directory’; .. means ‘the directory above the current one’.",

    "text": "Creating Directories and Files\nWe now know how to explore files and directories, but how do we create them in the first place?\nIn this episode we will learn about creating and moving files and directories, using the exercise-data/writing directory as an example.\n\nStep one: see where we are and what we already have\nWe should still be in the shell-lesson-data directory on the Desktop, which we can check using:\n$ pwd\n/Users/cdcapano/Desktop/shell-lesson-data\nNext we’ll move to the exercise-data/writing directory and see what it contains:\n$ cd exercise-data/writing/\n$ ls -F\nhaiku.txt  LittleWomen.txt\n\n\nCreate a directory\nLet’s create a new directory called thesis using the command mkdir thesis (which has no output):\n$ mkdir thesis\nAs you might guess from its name, mkdir means ‘make directory’. Since thesis is a relative path (i.e., does not have a leading slash, like /what/ever/thesis), the new directory is created in the current working directory:\n$ ls -F\nhaiku.txt  LittleWomen.txt  thesis/\nSince we’ve just created the thesis directory, there’s nothing in it yet:\n$ ls -F thesis\nNote that mkdir is not limited to creating single directories one at a time. The -p option allows mkdir to create a directory with nested subdirectories in a single operation:\n$ mkdir -p ../project/data ../project/results\nThe -R option to the ls command will list all nested subdirectories within a directory. Let’s use ls -FR to recursively list the new directory hierarchy we just created in the project directory:\n$ ls -FR ../project\n../project/:\ndata/  results/\n\n../project/data:\n\n../project/results:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTwo ways of doing the same thing\n\n\n\nUsing the shell to create a directory is no different than using a file explorer. If you open the current directory using your operating system’s graphical file explorer, the thesis directory will appear there too. While the shell and the file explorer are two different ways of interacting with the files, the files and directories themselves are the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteGood names for files and directories\n\n\n\nComplicated names of files and directories can make your life painful when working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful tips for the names of your files and directories.\n\nDon’t use spaces.\n\nSpaces can make a name more meaningful, but since spaces are used to separate arguments on the command line it is better to avoid them in names of files and directories. You can use - or _ instead (e.g. north-pacific-gyre/ rather than north pacific gyre/). To test this out, try typing mkdir north pacific gyre and see what directory (or directories!) are made when you check with ls -F.\n\nDon’t begin the name with - (dash).\n\nCommands treat names starting with - as options.\n\nStick with letters, numbers, . (period or ‘full stop’), - (dash) and _ (underscore).\n\nMany other characters have special meanings on the command line. We will learn about some of these during this lesson. There are special characters that can cause your command to not work as expected and can even result in data loss.\nIf you need to refer to names of files or directories that have spaces or other special characters, you should surround the name in single quotes ('').\n\n\n\n\nCreate a text file\nLet’s change our working directory to thesis using cd, then run a text editor called Nano to create a file called draft.txt:\n$ cd thesis\n$ nano draft.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteWhich editor?\n\n\n\nWhen we say, ‘nano is a text editor’ we really do mean ‘text’. It can only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other human-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is one of the least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS), many programmers use Emacs or Vim (both of which require more time to learn), or a graphical editor such as Gedit or VScode. On Windows, you may wish to use Notepad++. Windows also has a built-in editor called notepad that can be run from the command line in the same way as nano for the purposes of this lesson.\nNo matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably) use your current working directory as its default location. If you use your computer’s start menu, it may want to save files in your Desktop or Documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to another directory the first time you ‘Save As…’\n\n\nLet’s type a few lines of text:\n\nOnce we’re happy with our text, we can press Ctrl+O (press the Ctrl or Control key and, while holding it down, press the O key) to write our data to disk. We will be asked to provide a name for the file that will contain our text. Press Return to accept the suggested default of draft.txt.\nOnce our file is saved, we can use Ctrl+X to quit the editor and return to the shell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipControl, Ctrl, or ^ Key\n\n\n\nThe Control key is also called the ‘Ctrl’ key. There are various ways in which using the Control key may be described. For example, you may see an instruction to press the Control key and, while holding it down, press the X key, described as any of:\n\nControl-X\nControl+X\nCtrl-X\nCtrl+X\n^X\nC-x\n\nIn nano, along the bottom of the screen you’ll see ^G Get Help ^O WriteOut. This means that you can use Control-G to get help and Control-O to save your file.\n\n\nnano doesn’t leave any output on the screen after it exits, but ls now shows that we have created a file called draft.txt:\n$ ls\ndraft.txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Creating Files a Different Way\n\n\n\nWe have seen how to create text files using the nano editor. Now, try the following command:\n$ touch my_file.txt\n\nWhat did the touch command do? When you look at your current directory using the GUI file explorer, does the file show up?\nUse ls -l to inspect the files. How large is my_file.txt?\nWhen might you want to create a file this way?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe touch command generates a new file called my_file.txt in your current directory. You can observe this newly generated file by typing ls at the command line prompt. my_file.txt can also be viewed in your GUI file explorer.\nWhen you inspect the file with ls -l, note that the size of my_file.txt is 0 bytes. In other words, it contains no data. If you open my_file.txt using your text editor it is blank.\nSome programs do not generate output files themselves, but instead require that empty files have already been generated. When the program is run, it searches for an existing file to populate with its output. The touch command allows you to efficiently generate a blank text file to be used by such programs.\n\n\n\n\nTo avoid confusion later on, we suggest removing the file you’ve just created before proceeding with the rest of the episode, otherwise future outputs may vary from those given in the lesson. To do this, use the following command:\n$ rm my_file.txt\n\n\n\nWhat’s in a name?\nYou may have noticed that all of your files are named ‘something dot something’, and in this part of the lesson, we always used the extension .txt. This is just a convention; we can call a file mythesis or almost anything else we want. However, most people use two-part names most of the time to help them (and their programs) tell different kinds of files apart. The second part of such a name is called the filename extension and indicates what type of data the file holds: .txt signals a plain text file, .pdf indicates a PDF document, .cfg is a configuration file full of parameters for some program or other, .png is a PNG image, and so on.\nThis is just a convention, albeit an important one. Files merely contain bytes; it’s up to us and our programs to interpret those bytes according to the rules for plain text files, PDF documents, configuration files, images, and so on.\nNaming a PNG image of a whale as whale.mp3 doesn’t somehow magically turn it into a recording of whale song, though it might cause the operating system to associate the file with a music player program. In this case, if someone double-clicked whale.mp3 in a file explorer program, the music player will automatically (and erroneously) attempt to open the whale.mp3 file.",

In this case, we’re moving thesis/draft.txt to thesis/quotes.txt, which has the same effect as renaming the file. Sure enough, ls shows us that thesis now contains one file called quotes.txt:\n$ ls thesis\nquotes.txt\nOne must be careful when specifying the target file name, since mv will silently overwrite any existing file with the same name, which could lead to data loss. By default, mv will not ask for confirmation before overwriting files. However, an additional option, mv -i (or mv --interactive), will cause mv to request such confirmation.\nNote that mv also works on directories.\nLet’s move quotes.txt into the current working directory. We use mv once again, but this time we’ll use just the name of a directory as the second argument to tell mv that we want to keep the filename but put the file somewhere new. (This is why the command is called ‘move’.) In this case, the directory name we use is the special directory name . that we mentioned earlier.\n$ mv thesis/quotes.txt .\nThe effect is to move the file from the directory it was in to the current working directory. ls now shows us that thesis is empty:\n$ ls thesis\n$\nAlternatively, we can confirm the file quotes.txt is no longer present in the thesis directory by explicitly trying to list it:\n$ ls thesis/quotes.txt\nls: cannot access 'thesis/quotes.txt': No such file or directory\nls with a filename or directory as an argument only lists the requested file or directory.

Let’s consider the shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes directory: *.pdb represents ethane.pdb, propane.pdb, and every file that ends with ‘.pdb’. On the other hand, p*.pdb only represents pentane.pdb and propane.pdb, because the ‘p’ at the front can only represent filenames that begin with the letter ‘p’.\n? is also a wildcard, but it represents exactly one character. So ?ethane.pdb could represent methane.pdb whereas *ethane.pdb represents both ethane.pdb and methane.pdb.\nWildcards can be used in combination with each other. For example, ???ane.pdb indicates three characters followed by ane.pdb, giving cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb.\nWhen the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a list of matching filenames before running the preceding command. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command as it is. For example, typing ls *.pdf in the alkanes directory (which contains only files with names ending with .pdb) results in an error message that there is no file called *.pdf. However, generally commands like wc and ls see the lists of file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that expands the wildcards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: List filenames matching a pattern\n\n\n\nWhen run in the alkanes directory, which ls command(s) will produce this output?\nethane.pdb   methane.pdb\n\nls *t*ane.pdb\nls *t?ne.*\nls *t??ne.pdb\nls ethane.*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe solution is 3.\n1. shows all files whose names contain zero or more characters (*) followed by the letter t, then zero or more characters (*) followed by ane.pdb. This gives ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb.\n2. shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (*) followed by the letter t, then a single character (?), then ne. followed by zero or more characters (*). This will give us octane.pdb and pentane.pdb but doesn’t match anything which ends in thane.pdb.\n3. fixes the problems of option 2 by matching two characters (??) between t and ne.

The goal is to copy the folder structure of the 2016-05-18 folder into a folder called 2016-05-20 so that your final directory structure looks like this:\n2016-05-20/\n└── data\n   ├── processed\n   └── raw\nWhich of the following set of commands would achieve this objective?

The first set uses relative paths to create the top-level directory before the subdirectories.\nThe third set of commands will give an error because the default behavior of mkdir won’t create a subdirectory of a non-existent directory: the intermediate level folders must be created first.\nThe fourth set of commands achieve this objective. Remember, the -p option, followed by a path of one or more directories, will cause mkdir to create any intermediate subdirectories as required.\nThe final set of commands generates the ‘raw’ and ‘processed’ directories at the same level as the ‘data’ directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Points\n\n\n\n\ncp [old] [new] copies a file.\nmkdir [path] creates a new directory.\nmv [old] [new] moves (renames) a file or directory.\nrm [path] removes (deletes) a file.\n* matches zero or more characters in a filename, so *.txt matches all files ending in .txt.\n? matches any single character in a filename, so ?.txt matches a.txt but not any.txt.\nUse of the Control key may be described in many ways, including Ctrl-X, Control-X, and ^X.\nThe shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it’s really gone.\nMost files’ names are something.extension. The extension isn’t required, and doesn’t guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.\nDepending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano.",

    "section": "Capturing output from commands",
    "text": "Capturing output from commands\n\nOutput page by page with less\nWe’ll continue to use cat in this lesson, for convenience and consistency, but it has the disadvantage that it always dumps the whole file onto your screen. More useful in practice is the command less (e.g. less lengths.txt). This displays a screenful of the file, and then stops. You can go forward one screenful by pressing the spacebar, or back one by pressing b. Press q to quit.\nWhich of these files contains the fewest lines? It’s an easy question to answer when there are only six files, but what if there were 6000? Our first step toward a solution is to run the command:\n$ wc -l *.pdb &gt; lengths.txt\nThe greater than symbol, &gt;, tells the shell to redirect the command’s output to a file instead of printing it to the screen. This command prints no screen output, because everything that wc would have printed has gone into the file lengths.txt instead. If the file doesn’t exist prior to issuing the command, the shell will create the file. If the file exists already, it will be silently overwritten, which may lead to data loss. Thus, redirect commands require caution.\nls lengths.txt confirms that the file exists:\n$ ls lengths.txt\nlengths.txt\nWe can now send the content of lengths.txt to the screen using cat lengths.txt. The cat command gets its name from ‘concatenate’ i.e. join together, and it prints the contents of files one after another. There’s only one file in this case, so cat just shows us what it contains:\n$ cat lengths.txt\n  20  cubane.pdb\n  12  ethane.pdb\n   9  methane.pdb\n  30  octane.pdb\n  21  pentane.pdb\n  15  propane.pdb\n 107  total\n\n\nFiltering output\nNext we’ll use the sort command to sort the contents of the lengths.txt file. But first we’ll do an exercise to learn a little about the sort command:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: What does sort -n do?\n\n\n\nThe file shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/numbers.txt contains the following lines:\n10\n2\n19\n22\n6\nIf we run sort on this file, the output is:\n10\n19\n2\n22\n6\nIf we run sort -n on the same file, we get this instead:\n2\n6\n10\n19\n22\nExplain why -n has this effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe -n option specifies a numerical rather than an alphanumerical sort.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will also use the -n option to specify that the sort is numerical instead of alphanumerical. This does not change the file; instead, it sends the sorted result to the screen:\n$ sort -n lengths.txt\n  9  methane.pdb\n 12  ethane.pdb\n 15  propane.pdb\n 20  cubane.pdb\n 21  pentane.pdb\n 30  octane.pdb\n107  total\nWe can put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called sorted-lengths.txt by putting &gt; sorted-lengths.txt after the command, just as we used &gt; lengths.txt to put the output of wc into lengths.txt. Once we’ve done that, we can run another command called head to get the first few lines in sorted-lengths.txt:\n$ sort -n lengths.txt &gt; sorted-lengths.txt\n$ head -n 1 sorted-lengths.txt\n  9  methane.pdb\nUsing -n 1 with head tells it that we only want the first line of the file; -n 20 would get the first 20, and so on. Since sorted-lengths.txt contains the lengths of our files ordered from least to greatest, the output of head must be the file with the fewest lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantRedirecting to the same file\n\n\n\nIt’s a very bad idea to try redirecting the output of a command that operates on a file to the same file. For example:\n$ sort -n lengths.txt &gt; lengths.txt\nDoing something like this may give you incorrect results and/or delete the contents of lengths.txt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: What Does &gt;&gt; Mean?\n\n\n\nWe have seen the use of &gt;, but there is a similar operator &gt;&gt; which works slightly differently. We’ll learn about the differences between these two operators by printing some strings. We can use the echo command to print strings e.g.\n$ echo The echo command prints text\nThe echo command prints text\nNow test the commands below to reveal the difference between the two operators:\n$ echo hello &gt; testfile01.txt\nand:\n$ echo hello &gt;&gt; testfile02.txt\nHint: Try executing each command twice in a row and then examining the output files.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the first example with &gt;, the string ‘hello’ is written to testfile01.txt, but the file gets overwritten each time we run the command.\nWe see from the second example that the &gt;&gt; operator also writes ‘hello’ to a file (in this case testfile02.txt), but appends the string to the file if it already exists (i.e. when we run it for the second time).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: appending data\n\n\n\nWe have already met the head command, which prints lines from the start of a file. tail is similar, but prints lines from the end of a file instead.\nConsider the file shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts/animals.csv. After these commands, select the answer that corresponds to the file animals-subset.csv:\n$ head -n 3 animals.csv &gt; animals-subset.csv\n$ tail -n 2 animals.csv &gt;&gt; animals-subset.csv\n\nThe first three lines of animals.csv\nThe last two lines of animals.csv\nThe first three lines and the last two lines of animals.csv\nThe second and third lines of animals.csv\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 3 is correct. For option 1 to be correct we would only run the head command. For option 2 to be correct we would only run the tail command. For option 4 to be correct we would have to pipe the output of head into tail -n 2 by doing head -n 3 animals.csv | tail -n 2 &gt; animals-subset.csv",

We can make it easier to understand by running sort and head together:\n$ sort -n lengths.txt | head -n 1\n  9  methane.pdb\nThe vertical bar, |, between the two commands is called a pipe.

    "section": "Tools designed to work together",
    "text": "Tools designed to work together\nThis idea of linking programs together is why Unix has been so successful. Instead of creating enormous programs that try to do many different things, Unix programmers focus on creating lots of simple tools that each do one job well, and that work well with each other. This programming model is called ‘pipes and filters’. We’ve already seen pipes; a filter is a program like wc or sort that transforms a stream of input into a stream of output. Almost all of the standard Unix tools can work this way. Unless told to do otherwise, they read from standard input, do something with what they’ve read, and write to standard output.\nThe key is that any program that reads lines of text from standard input and writes lines of text to standard output can be combined with every other program that behaves this way as well. You can and should write your programs this way so that you and other people can put those programs into pipes to multiply their power.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Pipe Reading Comprehension\n\n\n\nA file called animals.csv (in the shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts folder) contains the following data:\n2012-11-05,deer,5\n2012-11-05,rabbit,22\n2012-11-05,raccoon,7\n2012-11-06,rabbit,19\n2012-11-06,deer,2\n2012-11-06,fox,4\n2012-11-07,rabbit,16\n2012-11-07,bear,1\nWhat text passes through each of the pipes and the final redirect in the pipeline below? Note, the sort -r command sorts in reverse order.\n$ cat animals.csv | head -n 5 | tail -n 3 | sort -r &gt; final.txt\nHint: build the pipeline up one command at a time to test your understanding\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe head command extracts the first 5 lines from animals.csv. Then, the last 3 lines are extracted from the previous 5 by using the tail command. With the sort -r command those 3 lines are sorted in reverse order. Finally, the output is redirected to a file: final.txt. The content of this file can be checked by executing cat final.txt. The file should contain the following lines:\n2012-11-06,rabbit,19\n2012-11-06,deer,2\n2012-11-05,raccoon,7\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Pipe Construction\n\n\n\nFor the file animals.csv from the previous exercise, consider the following command:\n$ cut -d , -f 2 animals.csv\nThe cut command is used to remove or ‘cut out’ certain sections of each line in the file, and cut expects the lines to be separated into columns by a Tab character. A character used in this way is called a delimiter. In the example above we use the -d option to specify the comma as our delimiter character. We have also used the -f option to specify that we want to extract the second field (column). This gives the following output:\ndeer\nrabbit\nraccoon\nrabbit\ndeer\nfox\nrabbit\nbear\nThe uniq command filters out adjacent matching lines in a file. How could you extend this pipeline (using uniq and another command) to find out what animals the file contains (without any duplicates in their names)?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n$ cut -d , -f 2 animals.csv | sort | uniq\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Which Pipe?\n\n\n\nThe file animals.csv contains 8 lines of data formatted as follows:\n2012-11-05,deer,5\n2012-11-05,rabbit,22\n2012-11-05,raccoon,7\n2012-11-06,rabbit,19\n...\nThe uniq command has a -c option which gives a count of the number of times a line occurs in its input. Assuming your current directory is shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts, what command would you use to produce a table that shows the total count of each type of animal in the file?\n\nsort animals.csv | uniq -c\nsort -t, -k2,2 animals.csv | uniq -c\ncut -d, -f 2 animals.csv | uniq -c\ncut -d, -f 2 animals.csv | sort | uniq -c\ncut -d, -f 2 animals.csv | sort | uniq -c | wc -l\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nOption 4. is the correct answer. If you have difficulty understanding why, try running the commands, or sub-sections of the pipelines (make sure you are in the shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/animal-counts directory).",

When you go back and check it, you see that you did that assay at 8:00 on a Monday morning — someone was probably in using the machine on the weekend, and you forgot to reset it. Before re-running that sample, you check to see if any files have too much data:\n$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | tail -n 5\n 300 NENE02040B.txt\n 300 NENE02040Z.txt\n 300 NENE02043A.txt\n 300 NENE02043B.txt\n5040 total\nThose numbers look good — but what’s that ‘Z’ doing there in the third-to-last line? All of your samples should be marked ‘A’ or ‘B’; by convention, your lab uses ‘Z’ to indicate samples with missing information. To find others like it, you do this:\n$ ls *Z.txt\nNENE01971Z.txt    NENE02040Z.txt\nSure enough, when you check the log on your laptop, there’s no depth recorded for either of those samples. Since it’s too late to get the information any other way, you must exclude those two files from your analysis. You could delete them using rm, but there are actually some analyses you might do later where depth doesn’t matter, so instead, you’ll have to be careful later on to select files using the wildcard expressions NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Points\n\n\n\n\nwc counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs.\ncat displays the contents of its inputs.\nsort sorts its inputs.\nhead displays the first 10 lines of its input by default without additional arguments.\ntail displays the last 10 lines of its input by default without additional arguments.\ncommand &gt; [file] redirects a command’s output to a file (overwriting any existing content).\ncommand &gt;&gt; [file] appends a command’s output to a file.\n[first] | [second] is a pipeline: the output of the first command is used as the input to the second.\nThe best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters).’ll have to be careful later on to select files using the wildcard expressions NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt.",

    "text": "Your pipeline: Processing files\nYou are now ready to process your data files using goostats.sh — a shell script written by your supervisor. This calculates some statistics from a protein sample file and takes two arguments:\n\nan input file (containing the raw data)\nan output file (to store the calculated statistics)\n\nSince you are still learning how to use the shell, you decides to build up the required commands in stages. Your first step is to make sure that you can select the right input files — remember, these are ones whose names end in ‘A’ or ‘B’, rather than ‘Z’. Moving to the north-pacific-gyre directory, you type:\n$ cd\n$ cd Desktop/shell-lesson-data/north-pacific-gyre\n$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt\n&gt; do\n&gt;     echo $datafile\n&gt; done\nNENE01729A.txt\nNENE01736A.txt\nNENE01751A.txt\n\n...\nNENE02040B.txt\nNENE02043B.txt\nYour next step is to decide what to call the files that the goostats.sh analysis program will create. Prefixing each input file’s name with ‘stats’ seems simple, so you modify your loop to do that:\n$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt\n&gt; do\n&gt;     echo $datafile stats-$datafile\n&gt; done\nNENE01729A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt\nNENE01736A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt\nNENE01751A.txt stats-NENE01729A.txt\n...\nNENE02040B.txt stats-NENE02040B.txt\nNENE02043B.txt stats-NENE02043B.txt\nYou haven’t actually run goostats.sh yet, but now you’re sure you can select the right files and generate the right output filenames.\nTyping in commands over and over again is becoming tedious, though, and you are worried about making mistakes, so instead of re-entering your loop, you press ↑. In response, the shell re-displays the whole loop on one line (using semi-colons to separate the pieces):\n$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done\nUsing the ←, you navigate to the echo command and change it to bash goostats.sh:\n$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done\nWhen you press Enter, the shell runs the modified command. However, nothing appears to happen — there is no output. After a moment, you realize that since your script doesn’t print anything to the screen any longer, you has no idea whether it is running, much less how quickly. You kill the running command by typing Ctrl+C, uses ↑ to repeat the command, and edit it to read:\n$ for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile;\nbash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipBeginning and end\n\n\n\nWe can move to the beginning of a line in the shell by typing Ctrl+A and to the end using Ctrl+E.\n\n\nWhen you run your program now, it produces one line of output every five seconds or so:\nNENE01729A.txt\nNENE01736A.txt\nNENE01751A.txt\n...\n1518 times 5 seconds, divided by 60, tells her that her script will take about two hours to run. As a final check, you open another terminal window, go into north-pacific-gyre, and uses cat stats-NENE01729B.txt to examine one of the output files. It looks good, so you decides to get some coffee and catch up on your reading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipThose who know history can choose to repeat it\n\n\n\nAnother way to repeat previous work is to use the history command to get a list of the last few hundred commands that have been executed, and then to use !123 (where ‘123’ is replaced by the command number) to repeat one of those commands. For example, if you types this:\n$ history | tail -n 5\n456  for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do   echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done\n457  for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile stats-$datafile; done\n458  for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile; done\n459  for datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt; do echo $datafile; bash goostats.sh $datafile\nstats-$datafile; done\n460  history | tail -n 5\nthen you can re-run goostats.sh on the files simply by typing !459.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipMore history commands\n\n\n\nThere are a number of other shortcut commands for getting at the history.\n\nCtrl+R enters a history search mode ‘reverse-i-search’ and finds the most recent command in your history that matches the text you enter next. Press Ctrl+R one or more additional times to search for earlier matches. You can then use the left and right arrow keys to choose that line and edit it then hit Return to run the command.\n!! retrieves the immediately preceding command (you may or may not find this more convenient than using ↑)\n!$ retrieves the last word of the last command. That’s useful more often than you might expect: after bash goostats.sh NENE01729B.txt stats-NENE01729B.txt, you can type less !$ to look at the file stats-NENE01729B.txt, which is quicker than doing ↑ and editing the command-line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Points\n\n\n\n\nA for loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.\nEvery for loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on.\nUse $name to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). ${name} can also be used.\nDo not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as ‘*’ or ‘?’ in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion.\nGive files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping.\nUse the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.\nUse Ctrl+R to search through the previously entered commands.\nUse history to display recent commands, and ![number] to repeat a command by number.",

    "text": "Your pipeline: Creating a script\nYour supervisor insisted that all your analytics must be reproducible. The easiest way to capture all the steps is in a script.\nFirst we return to your project directory:\n$ cd ../../north-pacific-gyre/\nYou create a file using nano …\n$ nano do-stats.sh\n…which contains the following:\n# Calculate stats for data files.\nfor datafile in \"$@\"\ndo\n    echo $datafile\n    bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile\ndone\nYou save this in a file called do-stats.sh so that you can now re-do the first stage of your analysis by typing:\n$ bash do-stats.sh NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt\nYou can also do this:\n$ bash do-stats.sh NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt | wc -l\nso that the output is just the number of files processed rather than the names of the files that were processed.\nOne thing to note about your script is that it lets the person running it decide what files to process. You could have written it as:\n# Calculate stats for Site A and Site B data files.\nfor datafile in NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt\ndo\n    echo $datafile\n    bash goostats.sh $datafile stats-$datafile\ndone\nThe advantage is that this always selects the right files: you doesn’t have to remember to exclude the ‘Z’ files. The disadvantage is that it always selects just those files — you can’t run it on all files (including the ‘Z’ files), or on the ‘G’ or ‘H’ files your colleagues in Antarctica are producing, without editing the script. If you wanted to be more adventurous, you could modify your script to check for command-line arguments, and use NENE*A.txt NENE*B.txt if none were provided. Of course, this introduces another tradeoff between flexibility and complexity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Variables in shell scripts\n\n\n\nIn the alkanes directory, imagine you have a shell script called script.sh containing the following commands:\nhead -n $2 $1\ntail -n $3 $1\nWhile you are in the alkanes directory, you type the following command:\n$ bash script.sh '*.pdb' 1 1\nWhich of the following outputs would you expect to see?\n\nAll of the lines between the first and the last lines of each file ending in .pdb in the alkanes directory\nThe first and the last line of each file ending in .pdb in the alkanes directory\nThe first and the last line of each file in the alkanes directory\nAn error because of the quotes around *.pdb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correct answer is 2.\nThe special variables $1, $2 and $3 represent the command line arguments given to the script, such that the commands run are:\n$ head -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb\n$ tail -n 1 cubane.pdb ethane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb\nThe shell does not expand '*.pdb' because it is enclosed by quote marks. As such, the first argument to the script is '*.pdb' which gets expanded within the script by head and tail\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Find the longest file with a given extension\n\n\n\nWrite a shell script called longest.sh that takes the name of a directory and a filename extension as its arguments, and prints out the name of the file with the most lines in that directory with that extension. For example:\n$ bash longest.sh shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes pdb\nwould print the name of the .pdb file in shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes that has the most lines.\nFeel free to test your script on another directory e.g.\n$ bash longest.sh shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/writing txt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n# Shell script which takes two arguments:\n#    1. a directory name\n#    2. a file extension\n# and prints the name of the file in that directory\n# with the most lines which matches the file extension.\n\nwc -l $1/*.$2 | sort -n | tail -n 2 | head -n 1\nThe first part of the pipeline, wc -l $1/*.$2 | sort -n, counts the lines in each file and sorts them numerically (largest last). When there’s more than one file, wc also outputs a final summary line, giving the total number of lines across all files. We use tail -n 2 | head -n 1 to throw away this last line.\nWith wc -l $1/*.$2 | sort -n | tail -n 1 we’ll see the final summary line: we can build our pipeline up in pieces to be sure we understand the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionChallenge: Script reading comprehension\n\n\n\nFor this question, consider the shell-lesson-data/exercise-data/alkanes directory once again. This contains a number of .pdb files in addition to any other files you may have created. Explain what each of the following three scripts would do when run as bash script1.sh *.pdb, bash script2.sh *.pdb, and bash script3.sh *.pdb respectively.\n# Script 1\necho *.*\n# Script 2\nfor filename in $1 $2 $3\ndo\n    cat $filename\ndone\n# Script 3\necho $@.pdb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nIn each case, the shell expands the wildcard in *.pdb before passing the resulting list of file names as arguments to the script.\nScript 1 would print out a list of all files containing a dot in their name. The arguments passed to the script are not actually used anywhere in the script.\nScript 2 would print the contents of the first 3 files with a .pdb file extension. $1, $2, and $3 refer to the first, second, and third argument respectively.\nScript 3 would print all the arguments to the script (i.e. all the .pdb files), followed by .pdb. $@ refers to all the arguments given to a shell script.\ncubane.pdb ethane.pdb methane.pdb octane.pdb pentane.pdb propane.pdb.pdb\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteKey Points\n\n\n\n\nSave commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use.\nbash [filename] runs the commands saved in a file.\n$@ refers to all of a shell script’s command-line arguments.\n$1, $2, etc., refer to the first command-line argument, the second command-line argument, etc.\nPlace variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them.\nLetting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands.",

For example consider the following JSON file of customer orders:\nThe file orders.json:\n[\n    {\n        \"Customer\" : { \"FirstName\" : \"Abby\", \"LastName\" : \"Kuss\"}, \n        \"Items\" : [\n            { \"Name\" : \"T-Shirt\", \"Price\" : 10.0, \"Quantity\" : 3},\n            { \"Name\" : \"Jacket\", \"Price\" : 20.0, \"Quantity\" : 1}\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"Customer\" : { \"FirstName\" : \"Bette\", \"LastName\" : \"Alott\"}, \n        \"Items\" : [\n            { \"Name\" : \"Shoes\", \"Price\" : 25.0, \"Quantity\" : 1}, \n            { \"Name\" : \"Jacket\", \"Price\" : 20.0, \"Quantity\" : 1}\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"Customer\" : { \"FirstName\" : \"Chris\", \"LastName\" : \"Peanugget\"}, \n        \"Items\" : [\n            { \"Name\" : \"T-Shirt\", \"Price\" : 10.0, \"Quantity\" : 1}\n        ]\n    }\n]\nWhen we read this with read_json() we get the three orders but only two columns — one for the \"Customer\" key, and the other for the \"Items\" key:\n\norders = pd.read_json(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mafudge/datasets/master/json-samples/orders.json\")\norders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomer\nItems\n\n\n\n\n0\n{'FirstName': 'Abby', 'LastName': 'Kuss'}\n[{'Name': 'T-Shirt', 'Price': 10.0, 'Quantity'...\n\n\n1\n{'FirstName': 'Bette', 'LastName': 'Alott'}\n[{'Name': 'Shoes', 'Price': 25.0, 'Quantity': ...\n\n\n2\n{'FirstName': 'Chris', 'LastName': 'Peanugget'}\n[{'Name': 'T-Shirt', 'Price': 10.0, 'Quantity'...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat we want is one row per item on the the order and the customer name to be in separate columns. The json_normalize() function can help here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that json_normalize() does not take a file as input, but rather de-serialized json (i.e., a dict or list of dicts).\n\n\nAn example (note that we first need to load the file as JSON dict; for that, we’ll use the requests module to download the data):\n\n# first down load the data\nimport requests\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mafudge/datasets/master/json-samples/orders.json\")\njson_data = response.json()  #de-serialize\nprint('Original JSON data:')\nprint(json_data)\n# now load into a DataFrame\norders = pd.json_normalize(json_data)\nprint(\"\\nLoaded DataFrame:\")\norders\n\nOriginal JSON data:\n[{'Customer': {'FirstName': 'Abby', 'LastName': 'Kuss'}, 'Items': [{'Name': 'T-Shirt', 'Price': 10.0, 'Quantity': 3}, {'Name': 'Jacket', 'Price': 20.0, 'Quantity': 1}]}, {'Customer': {'FirstName': 'Bette', 'LastName': 'Alott'}, 'Items': [{'Name': 'Shoes', 'Price': 25.0, 'Quantity': 1}, {'Name': 'Jacket', 'Price': 20.0, 'Quantity': 1}]}, {'Customer': {'FirstName': 'Chris', 'LastName': 'Peanugget'}, 'Items': [{'Name': 'T-Shirt', 'Price': 10.0, 'Quantity': 1}]}]\n\nLoaded DataFrame:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItems\nCustomer.FirstName\nCustomer.LastName\n\n\n\n\n0\n[{'Name': 'T-Shirt', 'Price': 10.0, 'Quantity'...\nAbby\nKuss\n\n\n1\n[{'Name': 'Shoes', 'Price': 25.0, 'Quantity': ...\nBette\nAlott\n\n\n2\n[{'Name': 'T-Shirt', 'Price': 10.0, 'Quantity'...\nChris\nPeanugget\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBetter but this only processed nested dict and not nested list. We still need to handle the list of Items. To accomplish this we :\n\nSet the record_path to be the nested list 'Items'. This tells json_normalize() to use that JSON key as the row level. So now we will have 5 rows (one for each item) instead of 3.\nThen we set the meta named argument to a list of each of the other values we wish to include, in this instance last name and first name.\n\nNote: The meta syntax is a bit weird. It’s a list of JSON paths (also represented as lists) to each item in the JSON. For example:\nThe meta Argument        ==&gt; Matches This in the JSON           ==&gt; And Displays As This Pandas Column\n[\"Customer\",\"FirstName\"] ==&gt; { \"Customer\" : { \"FirstName\": ...} ==&gt; Customer.Firstname\n\norders = pd.json_normalize(json_data, record_path=\"Items\", meta=[[\"Customer\",\"FirstName\"],[\"Customer\",\"LastName\"]])\norders\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nPrice\nQuantity\nCustomer.FirstName\nCustomer.LastName\n\n\n\n\n0\nT-Shirt\n10.0\n3\nAbby\nKuss\n\n\n1\nJacket\n20.0\n1\nAbby\nKuss\n\n\n2\nShoes\n25.0\n1\nBette\nAlott\n\n\n3\nJacket\n20.0\n1\nBette\nAlott\n\n\n4\nT-Shirt\n10.0\n1\nChris\nPeanugget\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYes it seems complicated, because conceptually it is a bit complicated. Let’s try another example, with some abstract values.\nIn the following example we want to generate a normalized table with 3 rows and 4 columns.\n\nThe rows are based on the \"A\" record_path, which has two sub-sets, A1 and A2. There are three sets of A data: (101, 102); (111, 112); and (201, 202).\nThe meta data are based on columns \"B\", and \"C1\"\n\n\njson_data = [\n    {\n        \"A\": [\n            {\"A1\": 101, \"A2\": 102},\n            {\"A1\": 111, \"A2\": 112}\n        ],\n        \"B\": 103,\n        \"C\": {\"C1\": 104}\n    },\n    {\n        \"A\": [\n            {\"A1\": 201, \"A2\": 202}\n        ],\n        \"B\": 203,\n        \"C\": {\"C1\": 204}\n    }\n]\n\ndf = pd.json_normalize(json_data, record_path=\"A\", meta=[\"B\", [\"C\", \"C1\"]])\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA1\nA2\nB\nC.C1\n\n\n\n\n0\n101\n102\n103\n104\n\n\n1\n111\n112\n103\n104\n\n\n2\n201\n202\n203\n204\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionCode Challenge 3.2\n\n\n\nUse the json_normalize function to tabularize this JSON data:\nhttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/mafudge/datasets/refs/heads/master/json-samples/employees.json\nThe final table should have these columns: dept, age, firstname, lastname.\nHint: read the file using the requests module, like in the above example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport requests\nimport pandas as pd\n\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mafudge/datasets/master/json-samples/employees.json\")\nemployees = response.json()\nemployees_df = pd.json_normalize(employees, record_path=[\"employees\"], meta=[\"dept\"])\nemployees_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfirstName\nlastName\nage\ndept\n\n\n\n\n0\nJohn\nDoe\n23\naccounting\n\n\n1\nMary\nSmith\n32\naccounting\n\n\n2\nSally\nGreen\n27\nsales\n\n\n3\nJim\nGalley\n41\nsales",

    "section": "Series",
    "text": "Series\nA Series is a named list of values.\nThe series has an index, too to reference each value. The default index is a zero based, similar to a python list.\n\ngrades = pd.Series(data=[100,80,90,np.nan,100], name=\"Midterm Grades\")\ngrades\n\n0    100.0\n1     80.0\n2     90.0\n3      NaN\n4    100.0\nName: Midterm Grades, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n# The the value at index 2\ngrades[2]\n\nnp.float64(90.0)\n\n\nThe index can be anyting . Here’s the same grades with student names as the index.\n\ngrades2 = pd.Series( data=[100,80,90,np.nan,100], \n                    name=\"Midterm Grades\",\n                    index=[\"Alice\", \"Bob\", \"Charlie\", \"David\", \"Eve\"])\ngrades2\n\nAlice      100.0\nBob         80.0\nCharlie     90.0\nDavid        NaN\nEve        100.0\nName: Midterm Grades, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n# Get Charlie's grade\ngrades2[\"Charlie\"]\n\nnp.float64(90.0)\n\n\n\nSeries Vectorized Functions\nLike NumPy arrays, you can perform element-wise mathematical operations on Pandas series without needing for loops (i.e., vectorization). For example:\n\n# add 5 points to all the grades\ngrades3 = grades2 + 5\nprint(grades3)\n\nAlice      105.0\nBob         85.0\nCharlie     95.0\nDavid        NaN\nEve        105.0\nName: Midterm Grades, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n# square the grades\ngradesq = grades2**2\nprint(gradesq)\n\nAlice      10000.0\nBob         6400.0\nCharlie     8100.0\nDavid          NaN\nEve        10000.0\nName: Midterm Grades, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n# add two series together\ngrades4 = grades2 + grades3\nprint(grades4)\n\nAlice      205.0\nBob        165.0\nCharlie    185.0\nDavid        NaN\nEve        205.0\nName: Midterm Grades, dtype: float64\n\n\nPandas series also have a number of vectorized methods that you can call on the series themselves, again like NumPy arrays. Some examples:\n\nprint(\"Highest grade:\", grades.max())\nprint(\"Average grade:\", grades.mean())\nprint(\"lowest grade:\", grades.min())\nprint(\"Sum of grades:\", grades.sum())\nprint(\"Count of grades\", grades.count())\n\nHighest grade: 100.0\nAverage grade: 92.5\nlowest grade: 80.0\nSum of grades: 370.0\nCount of grades 4\n\n\n\n\nOther Series Functions\nWe can use the unique() method function to return only the non-duplicate values from the series.\nThe value_counts() method function adds up values, creating a new series where the index is the value and the value is the count.\nFor example consider the following series:\n\nvotes = pd.Series(data=[ 'y','y','y','n','y',np.nan,'n','n','y'], name=\"Vote\")\nprint(\"deduplicate the votes:\", votes.unique())\nprint(\"counts by value:\", votes.value_counts())\n\ndeduplicate the votes: ['y' 'n' nan]\ncounts by value: Vote\ny    5\nn    3\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n\nComparison to NumPy\nIn many ways, you can think of a Pandas series as being like a NumPy array (in fact, series are built on top of NumPy arrays). It even has similar performance. For example:\n\na = np.arange(1000000)\naseries = pd.Series(a)\n\n\n%timeit a.mean()\n\n537 μs ± 807 ns per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)\n\n\n\n%timeit aseries.mean()\n\n549 μs ± 1.05 μs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)\n\n\nHowever, unlike NumPy arrays, Pandas series can only be one dimensional. Example:\n\n# 2D NumPy array? No problem!\na = np.ones((1000, 1000))\nprint(a.shape)\n\n(1000, 1000)\n\n\n\n# 2D Pandas series?

    "text": "DataFrame\nFor 2D data, you use a Pandas DataFrame. A DataFrame is a table representation of data. It is the primary use case for pandas itself. A DataFrame is simply a collection of Series that share a common index. It’s like a programmable spreadsheet: it has rows and columns which can be accessed and manipulated with Python.\nAn example:\n\nnames = pd.Series( data = ['Allen','Bob','Chris','Dave','Ed','Frank','Gus'])\ngpas = pd.Series( data = [4.0, np.nan, 3.4, 2.8, 2.5, 3.8, 3.0])\nyears = pd.Series( data = ['So', 'Fr', 'Fr', 'Jr', 'Sr', 'Sr', 'Fr'])\nseries_dict = { 'Name':  names, 'GPA': gpas, 'Year' : years }  # dict of Series, keys are the series names\nstudents = pd.DataFrame( series_dict )\nstudents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nGPA\nYear\n\n\n\n\n0\nAllen\n4.0\nSo\n\n\n1\nBob\nNaN\nFr\n\n\n2\nChris\n3.4\nFr\n\n\n3\nDave\n2.8\nJr\n\n\n4\nEd\n2.5\nSr\n\n\n5\nFrank\n3.8\nSr\n\n\n6\nGus\n3.0\nFr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Ways to create dataframes:\n\n# Lists of lists\npd.DataFrame([['Tom', 7], ['Mike', 15], ['Tiffany', 3]])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n\n\n\n\n0\nTom\n7\n\n\n1\nMike\n15\n\n\n2\nTiffany\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Dictionary\npd.DataFrame({\"Name\": ['Tom', 'Mike', 'Tiffany'], \"Number\": [7, 15, 3]})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nNumber\n\n\n\n\n0\nTom\n7\n\n\n1\nMike\n15\n\n\n2\nTiffany\n3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more, see the Pandas documentation on DataFrames.\n\n\nDataFrames share the index\nThe dataframe is stitched together from values macthing on their index. For example:\n\ngpas = pd.Series(data=[4.0, np.nan, 3.4, 2.8, 2.5 ], index=['Allen','Bob','Chris','Ed', 'Frank'])\nyrs = pd.Series(data=['So', 'Fr', 'Jr', 'Sr'], index=['Allen','Bob','Dave', 'Frank'])\nstudents = pd.DataFrame( {'GPA': gpas, 'Year': yrs})\nstudents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPA\nYear\n\n\n\n\nAllen\n4.0\nSo\n\n\nBob\nNaN\nFr\n\n\nChris\n3.4\nNaN\n\n\nDave\nNaN\nJr\n\n\nEd\n2.8\nNaN\n\n\nFrank\n2.5\nSr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing elements with indexing\nYou can access columns in the DataFrame using the names of the series, much in the same way you would a dictionary. For example:\n\nstudents['GPA'] # slicing by row label\n\nAllen    4.0\nBob      NaN\nChris    3.4\nDave     NaN\nEd       2.8\nFrank    2.5\nName: GPA, dtype: float64\n\n\nSince the values in a DataFrame are Series, you can then access a particular value using the Series index. For example, since the Series data in studentsn were indexed by name, we can get Chris’s grade by doing:\n\nstudents['GPA']['Chris']\n\nnp.float64(3.4)\n\n\nMuch like a Series is like a special NumPy array with fancy indexing (and other useful features), a DataFrame is like a special type of dictionary, with some extra features that make handling datasets much easier. In fact, as we’ll see below, a DataFrame is more like a cross between a dictionary and a NumPy array that make it excel at data wrangling. (pun intended)\n\nAccessing elements with loc and iloc\nThe loc[index, col] and iloc[row_pos, col_pos] properties allow you to slice the dataframe. loc uses the index and column names, while iloc uses ordinal positions starting at zero.\nHere are some examples, using studentsn\n\n# Examples using loc\nprint(\"loc: Get the Chris' GPA: \", students.loc['Chris', 'GPA'])\nprint(\"loc: Get the Year of the last student (Frank): \", students.loc['Frank', 'Year'])\n\n# Same examples using iloc\nprint(\"iloc: Get the GPA of the student at row 2 (Chris): \", students.iloc[2, 0])\nprint(\"iloc: Get the Year of the last student (Frank): \", students.iloc[-1, 1])\n\nloc: Get the Chris' GPA:  3.4\nloc: Get the Year of the last student (Frank):  Sr\niloc: Get the GPA of the student at row 2 (Chris):  3.4\niloc: Get the Year of the last student (Frank):  Sr\n\n\n\n# You can also slice using loc and iloc\nprint(\"loc: last two rows:\\n\", students.loc['Ed':, 'GPA':'Year'])\nprint()\nprint(\"iloc: last two rows:\\n\", students.iloc[-2:, 0:2])\n\nloc: last two rows:\n        GPA Year\nEd     2.8  NaN\nFrank  2.5   Sr\n\niloc: last two rows:\n        GPA Year\nEd     2.8  NaN\nFrank  2.5   Sr\n\n\n\n\nNull Checks\nuse isna() to check for np.nan.\n\nstudents[students.GPA.isna()]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPA\nYear\n\n\n\n\nBob\nNaN\nFr\n\n\nDave\nNaN\nJr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionCode Challenge 2.1\n\n\n\nCreate this DataFrame:\n   s1   s2 s3\na   1  2.2  q\nb   2  NaN  q\nc   3  3.0  z\nd   4  1.5  z\nIn other words, the frame should have 3 columns named s1, s2, and s3, and the rows should be indexed with the strings a, b, c, and d.

We can load the file directly as a DataFrame using Panda’s read_csv function. Notice that we can pass a URL to the function. We don’t need to first download, Pandas will take care of that for us all under the hood!\n\ncustomers =

Streamlit.\nHere is an example:\n\nimport streamlit as st\nimport pandas as pd\n\nst.title(\"Dataframe Example\")\n\ncustomers = pd.read_csv('https://su-ist356-m003-fall-2025.github.io/course-home/04_data_wrangling/customers.csv')\n\nst.dataframe(customers.head(20))\nst.dataframe(customers.describe())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionCode Challenge 2.2\n\n\n\nSimilar to the previous example, load this file into a customers dataframe:\nhttps://su-ist356-m003-fall-2025.github.io/course-home/04_data_wrangling/customers.csv\nThen create a radio widget to allow the user to select Head or Tail and a number input widget to enter a number of lines.\nOutput the head or tail of the dataframe and only show the number of lines input.\nHint: Use Streamlit’s radio and number_input functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport streamlit as st\nimport pandas as pd\n\nst.title('My first dataframe')\n\ncustomers = pd.read_csv('https://su-ist356-m003-fall-2025.github.io/course-home/04_data_wrangling/customers.csv')\n\nradio = st.radio('Show:', options=[ 'Head', 'Tail'], index=0)\nrows = st.number_input('Rows:', min_value=1, max_value=len(customers), value=5)\nif radio == 'Head':\n    st.dataframe(customers.head(rows))\nelse:\n    st.dataframe(customers.tail(rows))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Rows and Columns\nWe can pair down the output of a dataframe by using:\n\na list of column names to select columns.\na boolean index to select matching rows.\n\n\ndata_dict = { \n    'Name':  ['Allen','Bob','Chris','Dave','Ed','Frank','Gus'], \n    'GPA': [4.0, np.nan, 3.4, 2.8, 2.5, 3.8, 3.0], \n    'Year' : ['So', 'Fr', 'Fr', 'Jr', 'Sr', 'Sr', 'Fr'] } \nstudents = pd.DataFrame( data_dict )\nstudents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nGPA\nYear\n\n\n\n\n0\nAllen\n4.0\nSo\n\n\n1\nBob\nNaN\nFr\n\n\n2\nChris\n3.4\nFr\n\n\n3\nDave\n2.8\nJr\n\n\n4\nEd\n2.5\nSr\n\n\n5\nFrank\n3.8\nSr\n\n\n6\nGus\n3.0\nFr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Columns\nThis example just gets the name and GPA columns\n\ncolumns_to_show = ['Name', 'GPA']\nstudents[columns_to_show]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nGPA\n\n\n\n\n0\nAllen\n4.0\n\n\n1\nBob\nNaN\n\n\n2\nChris\n3.4\n\n\n3\nDave\n2.8\n\n\n4\nEd\n2.5\n\n\n5\nFrank\n3.8\n\n\n6\nGus\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting the freshmen using a boolean index\nconsider the following:\n\nstudents['Year'] == 'Fr'\n\n0    False\n1     True\n2     True\n3    False\n4    False\n5    False\n6     True\nName: Year, dtype: bool\n\n\nThis it called a boolean index. The boolean expression is evaluted for each index in the DataFrame. It’s similar to the boolean “mask” array we used for extracting values from an array in the NumPy unit.\nWhen we apply the boolean index to the dataframe, only the rows where the index evaluates to True are returned.\n\nstudents[students['Year'] == 'Fr'] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nGPA\nYear\n\n\n\n\n1\nBob\nNaN\nFr\n\n\n2\nChris\n3.4\nFr\n\n\n6\nGus\n3.0\nFr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLikewise we can assign these variables for clarity\n\nonly_freshmen_index = students['Year'] == 'Fr'\nonly_freshmen = students[only_freshmen_index]\nonly_freshmen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nGPA\nYear\n\n\n\n\n1\nBob\nNaN\nFr\n\n\n2\nChris\n3.4\nFr\n\n\n6\nGus\n3.0\nFr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd Or and Not with Boolean indexes\nWhat if we want freshmen or seniors? We cannot use or in this case, instead we must use the python bitwise or operator. This is because the series contains multiple values.\nBitwise Operators\n\nand &\nor |\nnot ~\n\nNote: () are required between each bitwise operator.\n\n# freshmen and seniors\nonly_freshmen_seniors = (students['Year'] == 'Fr') | (students['Year'] == 'Sr')\nstudents[only_freshmen_seniors]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nGPA\nYear\n\n\n\n\n1\nBob\nNaN\nFr\n\n\n2\nChris\n3.4\nFr\n\n\n4\nEd\n2.5\nSr\n\n\n5\nFrank\n3.8\nSr\n\n\n6\nGus\n3.0\nFr\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPutting it Together\nGet the name and GPA of only the freshmen that have a GPA stored (i.e., for which the GPA is not a NaN):\n\ncols = ['Name', 'GPA']\nfr_with_gpa = (students['Year'] == 'Fr') & (students['GPA'].notna())\nstudents[fr_with_gpa][cols]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nGPA\n\n\n\n\n2\nChris\n3.4\n\n\n6\nGus\n3.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionCode Challenge 2.3\n\n\n\nSimilar to the previous example, load this file into a customers dataframe:\nhttps://su-ist356-m003-fall-2025.github.io/course-home/04_data_wrangling/customers.csv\nThen:\n\nCreate a radio widget to allow the user to select “M” or “F” for gender,\na multi-select widget to pick which columns to display (Hint: use Streamlit’s multiselect method),\nand filter the rows to match the gender and selected columns.\n\nDisplay the dataframe in the Streamlit app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport streamlit as st\nimport pandas as pd\n\nst.title('Customers')\ncustomers = pd.read_csv('https://su-ist356-m003-fall-2025.github.io/course-home/04_data_wrangling/customers.csv')\nradio = st.radio('Gender:', options=[ 'M', 'F'], index=0)\ncols = st.multiselect('Columns:', options=customers.columns)\ngender_index = customers['Gender'] == radio\nst.dataframe(customers[gender_index][cols])",

    "text": "A Module is a file containing Python code.\nThe Code in the module can be included in your code using the import command\nA collection of modules bundled for re-distribution is known as a Package\n\n\n\n\nThe Python language has several modules which are included with the base language: Python Standard Library https://docs.python.org/3/library/\nIn addition you can import other libraries found on the Internet.\nThe Python Package Index is a website which allows you to search for other code avaialbe for use. https://pypi.org/\nOnce you know which package you want, you can install it with the pip command from the terminal.\nExample: pip install &lt;name-of-package&gt; (Make sure you activate your conda environment first!)\nYou can also install packages using conda. For example, conda install -c conda-forge &lt;name-of-package&gt;.\nWhich to use? Basically, conda and pip can be used interchangeably within a conda environment. Some packages may be in PyPI that are not in conda-forge and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\nrequirements.txt is a file which stores the names of all the packages a project uses\nadding them to the file is a replacement for installing each of them manually\nto install the packages: pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n\n\nCode in the module can be included in your code using the import command. There are a few different ways to import some code:\n\nimport foo imports code from module foo. Functions in that module can then be referenced in the current code by prefixing the function with foo.. For example, if foo has a function bar defined in it, then after the import foo statement you can use the bar function by writing foo.bar(...) (where the ... indicate the arguments you need to pass to bar).\nfrom foo import bar,baz only imports the bar and baz functions from module foo. When imported in this manner, the bar and baz functions are referenced directly, without the module prefix. For example, in this case, to execute the bar function, you run bar(...) instead of foo.bar(...).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteConcept check\n\n\n\nWhat’s wrong with the following code?\n\nexp = 'Dear {name}, we would like to express our gratitude for your donation!'\n\nfrom math import exp\n\nprint(exp.format(name=\"Jeff\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteSolution\n\n\n\n\n\nThe from math import exp line will cause the exp variable in the namespace that’s defined in the first line to be replaced by the exponential function in the math module. This will cause an error in the last line, which expects exp to be a string, not a function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenaming imports: You can avoid namespace collisions by renaming an imported module or functions via: import foo as f. For example, in the Concept check above, doing from math import exp as mathexp would avoid the error.\n\n\n\n\n\nUse the dir(&lt;module&gt;) to list the functions in the module\nUse help(module.function) to get the docstring for a function in a module.\n\n\n# Examples\nimport math\n\n\n# get the functions\ndir(math)\n\n['__doc__',\n '__file__',\n '__loader__',\n '__name__',\n '__package__',\n '__spec__',\n 'acos',\n 'acosh',\n 'asin',\n 'asinh',\n 'atan',\n 'atan2',\n 'atanh',\n 'cbrt',\n 'ceil',\n 'comb',\n 'copysign',\n 'cos',\n 'cosh',\n 'degrees',\n 'dist',\n 'e',\n 'erf',\n 'erfc',\n 'exp',\n 'exp2',\n 'expm1',\n 'fabs',\n 'factorial',\n 'floor',\n 'fma',\n 'fmod',\n 'frexp',\n 'fsum',\n 'gamma',\n 'gcd',\n 'hypot',\n 'inf',\n 'isclose',\n 'isfinite',\n 'isinf',\n 'isnan',\n 'isqrt',\n 'lcm',\n 'ldexp',\n 'lgamma',\n 'log',\n 'log10',\n 'log1p',\n 'log2',\n 'modf',\n 'nan',\n 'nextafter',\n 'perm',\n 'pi',\n 'pow',\n 'prod',\n 'radians',\n 'remainder',\n 'sin',\n 'sinh',\n 'sqrt',\n 'sumprod',\n 'tan',\n 'tanh',\n 'tau',\n 'trunc',\n 'ulp']\n\n\n\nhelp(math.pow)\n\nHelp on built-in function pow in module math:\n\npow(x, y, /)\n    Return x**y (x to the power of y).\n\n\n\n\nmath.pow(2,5) # 2*2*2*2*2\n\n32.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionCode Challenge 4.1\n\n\n\nUse the datetime module to parse a “Month/Day/Year” string (e.g., “9/15/2025”) into a datetime then print it in YYYY-MM-DD format (e.g., “2025-09-15”).\nYou will need to read through the module with dir() and help() or read the python docs to determine which functions to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ntext = input(\"Enter date m/d/y: \")\nnow = datetime.strptime(text, \"%m/%d/%Y\")\nnowstr = now.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\nprint(nowstr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionCode Challenge 4.2\n\n\n\nLet’s make the code in Challenge 4.2 more resusable:\n\nRe-write the date parse into a function parsedate_mdy(text: str) -&gt; datetime:.\nRe-write the date format into a function formatdate_ymd(date: datetime) -&gt; str:.\nRe-write the main program to use both functions. input -&gt; parsedate -&gt; formatdate -&gt; output\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\ndef parsedate_mdy(text: str) -&gt; datetime:\n    dt = datetime.strptime(text, \"%m/%d/%Y\")\n    return dt\n\n\ndef formatdate_ymd(date: datetime) -&gt; str:\n    return date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\n\ntext = input(\"Enter date m/d/y: \")\ndate = parsedate_mdy(text)\ndate_str = formatdate_ymd(date)\nprint(date_str)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionCode Challenge 4.3\n\n\n\nLet’s make the code in Challenge 4.2 even more resusable!\n\nMove your functions into a module name dateutils.py.\nImport your functions from dateutils.py into 4-3.py\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate the dateutils.py file in VS Code by clicking “File” -&gt; “New File”. Name it dateutils.py. Then copy the functions you wrote in Challenge 4.2 into it (don’t forget the from datetime import datetime at the top!). Save the file by typing CTRL/CMD + S or clicking File -&gt; Save.\nTo use your functions in a notebook or another python script:\n\nfrom dateutils import parsedate_mdy, formatdate_ymd\n\ntext = input(\"Enter date m/d/y: \")\ndate = parsedate_mdy(text)\ndate_str = formatdate_ymd(date)\nprint(date_str)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantAvoid wildcard imports!\n\n\n\nIt’s possible to use a wildcard * when importing. For example,\n\nfrom math import *\n\nwill import all functions that are in the math module into the current namespace. This means that you could then call math.pow with just pow, for example.\nDon’t do this! The problem with this is you can accidentally override variables in your program without realizing it. For example, if you defined a variable called e then did from math import *, e would be replaced with the value of the natural exponent, since e is defined in the math module. Doing wildcard imports also makes it difficult to debug code, since it’s a challenge to determine what module a particular variable came from. Wildcard imports should only be used in very limited situations, which you are unlikely to run in to. Long story short… don’t use wildcard imports! I only tell you about it in case you see it in the wild (no pun intended).",

    "text": "Python list recap\nWe saw previously that arrays allow us to store a series of values in a single variable. For example:\n\nlistnumbers = [1, 2, 3]\nprint(listnumbers)\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n\n\nNotably, in Python, a list can contain objects that are not of the same data type. For example:\n\nlist1 = [1, \"string\", {'a':1}, [[1, 3], set()]]  # arbitrary objects\nprint(list1)\n\n[1, 'string', {'a': 1}, [[1, 3], set()]]\n\n\nAdding two lists concatenates them, there is no mathematical operation: adding two containers that contain arbitrary objects means “combining” them.\n\nlistadd = list1 + listnumbers\nprint(listadd)\n\n[1, 'string', {'a': 1}, [[1, 3], set()], 1, 2, 3]\n\n\nBeing able to store multiple data types in a single list can be convenient. However, Python lists can be cumbersome to work with when doing mathematical operations, and for more complex and multi-dimensional data. They are also relatively slow to process. For example, say we wanted to add two large lists of values together. We would need to do the following:\n\n# create large list a\na = range(1000000)\nb = range(1000000)\nadded_list = [ai+bi for ai, bi in zip(a, b)]\n\nLet’s time how long it took to do that last line. For that, we can use the %timeit magic command in a jupyter notebook:\n\n%timeit added_list = [ai+bi for ai, bi in zip(a, b)]\n\n94.3 ms ± 819 μs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10 loops each)\n\n\nWhile this may seem fast in human time, it’s quite slow computationally wise. If you had multiple operations like this it would quickly add up. As we will see below, it’s possible to do array operations like this much more quickly using NumPy.",

    "section": "NumPy arrays",
    "text": "NumPy arrays\nFor much faster, easier manipulation of numerical arrays, we use NumPy. What is NumPy? A good summary is provided by Claude AI:\n\nNumPy is a fundamental Python library for scientific computing that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It offers a comprehensive collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently, with operations implemented in C for high performance. NumPy serves as the foundation for most other scientific Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib, making it essential for data science, machine learning, and numerical analysis workflows.\n\nLet’s see how to do some basic array operations with numpy. First, if you have not done so, you’ll need to install numpy into your conda environment. To do so, in a terminal, activate your conda environment, then either run:\npip install numpy\nor\nconda install -y -c conda-forge numpy\nWe can now import numpy:\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n\nNumPy array creation\nThere are multiple ways to create an array using numpy. Some examples:\n\n# from a Python list:\narrnumbers = np.array(listnumbers)\nprint(\"arrnumbers:\", arrnumbers)\n\n# manually creating it:\narrnumbers2 = np.array([5, 3, 42])\nprint(\"arrnumbers2:\", arrnumbers2)\n\n# from a range of values (compare to range above):\narrnumbers3 = np.arange(1000000)\nprint(\"arrnumbers3:\", arrnumbers3)\n\n# an array of values linearlly spaced between two endpoints:\narrlinspace = np.linspace(0, 10, 5)  # 5 values equally spaced between 0 and 10\nprint(\"arrlinspace:\", arrlinspace)\n\n# an array of zeros:\narrzeros = np.zeros(4)\nprint(\"arrzeros:\", arrzeros)\n\n# an array of ones:\narrones = np.ones(4)\nprint(\"arrones:\", arrones)\n\n# an empty array (values will be whatever is in memory at the time):\narrempty = np.empty(4)\nprint(\"arrempty:\", arrempty)\n\narrnumbers: [1 2 3]\narrnumbers2: [ 5  3 42]\narrnumbers3: [     0      1      2 ... 999997 999998 999999]\narrlinspace: [ 0.   2.5  5.   7.5 10. ]\narrzeros: [0. 0. 0. 0.]\narrones: [1. 1. 1. 1.]\narrempty: [1. 1. 1. 1.]\n\n\nNumPy arrays can have multiple dimensions:\n\narr2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\nprint(arr2d)\n\n# we can get the number of dimensions with .ndim:\nprint(\"arr2d.ndim:\", arr2d.ndim)\n\n# or the shape with .shape:\nprint(\"arr2d.shape:\", arr2d.shape) # returns the number of rows and columns\n\n[[1 2 3]\n [4 5 6]]\narr2d.ndim: 2\narr2d.shape: (2, 3)\n\n\nMany array constructor functions take a shape argument to create a mult-dimensional array:\n\nzeros2d = np.zeros((3, 4))  # 3 rows, 4 columns\nprint(\"zeros2d:\\n\", zeros2d)\n\nones3d = np.ones((2, 3, 4))  # 2 blocks, 3 rows, 4 columns\nprint(\"ones3d:\\n\", ones3d)\n\nzeros2d:\n [[0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0.]\n [0. 0. 0. 0.]]\nones3d:\n [[[1. 1. 1. 1.]\n  [1. 1. 1. 1.]\n  [1. 1. 1. 1.]]\n\n [[1. 1. 1. 1.]\n  [1. 1. 1. 1.]\n  [1. 1. 1. 1.]]]\n\n\nOr, we can reshape a current array:\n\narrnumbers2d = arrnumbers3.reshape(1000, 1000)  # 1000 rows, 1000 columns\nprint(\"arrnumbers3.shape:\", arrnumbers3.shape)\nprint(\"arrnumbers3:\\n\", arrnumbers3)\n\nprint(\"arrnumbers2d.shape:\", arrnumbers2d.shape)\nprint(\"arrnumbers2d:\\n\", arrnumbers2d)\n\narrnumbers3.shape: (1000000,)\narrnumbers3:\n [     0      1      2 ... 999997 999998 999999]\narrnumbers2d.shape: (1000, 1000)\narrnumbers2d:\n [[     0      1      2 ...    997    998    999]\n [  1000   1001   1002 ...   1997   1998   1999]\n [  2000   2001   2002 ...   2997   2998   2999]\n ...\n [997000 997001 997002 ... 997997 997998 997999]\n [998000 998001 998002 ... 998997 998998 998999]\n [999000 999001 999002 ... 999997 999998 999999]]\n\n\n\n\nArray slicing\nSimilar to Python lists, we can access elements of a list using braces and indices. The syntax is:\narr[start:end:step]\nSome examples:\n\n# print a single element in arrnumbers:\nprint(arrnumbers[0]) # first element\nprint(arrnumbers[1]) # second element\n\n1\n2\n\n\n\n# print a range of elements in arrnumbers:\nprint('arrnumbers[0:2]:', arrnumbers[0:2])\n\n# equivalently:\nprint('arrnumbers[:2]:', arrnumbers[:2])  # start is 0 by default\n\n# or to print from an index to the end:\nprint('arrnumbers[1:]:', arrnumbers[1:])  # goes to the end by default\n\n# or to print all numbers:\nprint('arrnumbers[:]:', arrnumbers[:])  # start and end are default\n\n# print every second element:\nprint('arrnumbers[::2]:', arrnumbers[::2])\n\narrnumbers[0:2]: [1 2]\narrnumbers[:2]: [1 2]\narrnumbers[1:]: [2 3]\narrnumbers[:]: [1 2 3]\narrnumbers[::2]: [1 3]\n\n\nNegative indices can be used to slice starting from the end, and to reverse order. For example:\n\nprint('arrnumbers[-2:]', arrnumbers[-2:])  # print the last two elements\nprint('arrnumbers[::-1]', arrnumbers[::-1])  # print all elements in reverse order\n\narrnumbers[-2:] [2 3]\narrnumbers[::-1] [3 2 1]\n\n\nFor multi-dimensional arrays, the same rules apply, you just separate the indexing for each dimension by commas. For example:\n\nprint(\"arr2d:\\n\", arr2d)\nprint(\"arr2d[0, 0]:\", arr2d[0, 0])  # first row, first column\nprint(\"arr2d[:, 0]:\", arr2d[:, 0])  # all rows, first column\nprint(\"arr2d[0, :]:\", arr2d[0, :])  # first row, all columns\nprint(\"arr2d[0:2, 1:3]:\\n\", arr2d[0:2, 1:3])  # first two rows, columns 1 and 2\n\narr2d:\n [[1 2 3]\n [4 5 6]]\narr2d[0, 0]: 1\narr2d[:, 0]: [1 4]\narr2d[0, :]: [1 2 3]\narr2d[0:2, 1:3]:\n [[2 3]\n [5 6]]\n\n\n\n\nSubarrays as no-copy views\nOne important–and extremely useful–thing to know about array slices is that they return views rather than copies of the array data. This is one area in which NumPy array slicing differs from Python list slicing: in lists, slices will be copies. Consider our two-dimensional array from before:\n\nprint(arr2d)\n\n[[1 2 3]\n [4 5 6]]\n\n\nLet’s extract a \\(2 \\times 2\\) subarray from this:\n\narr2d_sub = arr2d[:2, :2]\nprint(arr2d_sub)\n\n[[1 2]\n [4 5]]\n\n\nNow if we modify this subarray, we’ll see that the original array is changed! Observe:\n\narr2d_sub[0, 0] = 99\nprint(arr2d_sub)\n\n[[99  2]\n [ 4  5]]\n\n\n\nprint(arr2d)\n\n[[99  2  3]\n [ 4  5  6]]\n\n\nThis default behavior is actually quite useful: it means that when we work with large datasets, we can access and process pieces of these datasets without the need to copy the underlying data buffer.\n\n\nCreating copies of arrays\nDespite the nice features of array views, it is sometimes useful to instead explicitly copy the data within an array or a subarray. This can be most easily done with the copy() method:\n\narr2d_sub_copy = arr2d[:2, :2].copy()\nprint(arr2d_sub_copy)\n\n[[99  2]\n [ 4  5]]\n\n\nIf we now modify this subarray, the original array is not touched:\n\narr2d_sub_copy[0, 0] = 42\nprint(arr2d_sub_copy)\n\n[[42  2]\n [ 4  5]]\n\n\n\nprint(arr2d)\n\n[[99  2  3]\n [ 4  5  6]]\n\n\n\n\nBoolean slicing\nYou can use boolean expressions to retrieve certain values in an array. For example:\n\n# print all the values in arrnumbers2 greater than 4:\nprint(\"arrnumbers:\\n\", arrnumbers2)\nprint(\"arrnumbers &gt; 5:\\n\", arrnumbers2[arrnumbers2 &gt; 4])  # boolean array\n\narrnumbers:\n [ 5  3 42]\narrnumbers &gt; 5:\n [ 5 42]\n\n\nWhat’s actually happening here is you’re first creating a boolean array. This is an array in which each element is either True or False. In this case, arrnumbers2 &gt; 4 is creating an array indicating which indices in arrnumbers2 are greater than 4. Passing the boolean array as an index then pulls out those values. We can see this if we break it into two steps:\n\nmask = arrnumbers2 &gt; 4\nprint(\"mask:\\n\", mask)\nprint(\"arrnumbers2[mask]:\\n\", arrnumbers2[mask])\n\nmask:\n [ True False  True]\narrnumbers2[mask]:\n [ 5 42]",

    "section": "Data types",
    "text": "Data types\nA key difference between NumPy arrays and Python arrays is that the data in a NumPy array must all be of the same type. You can get the data type of the values in an array using .dtype. For example:\n\nprint('arrnumbers:', arrnumbers)\nprint('arrnumbers.dtype:', arrnumbers.dtype)\n\narrnumbers: [1 2 3]\narrnumbers.dtype: int64\n\n\n\nprint('arrones:', arrones)\nprint('arrones.dtype:', arrones.dtype)\n\narrones: [1. 1. 1. 1.]\narrones.dtype: float64\n\n\n\nprint('mask:', mask)\nprint('mask.dtype:', mask.dtype)\n\nmask: [ True False  True]\nmask.dtype: bool\n\n\nIf you try to create an array with different data types, numpy will automatically cast them to all be the same. For example:\n\nmixed = np.array([1, 2.0, 3, 4.8, True, False])  # ints, floats, bools\nprint(\"mixed:\", mixed)\nprint(\"mixed.dtype:\", mixed.dtype)  # everything cast to float (note that True -&gt; 1, False -&gt; 0)\n\nmixed: [1.  2.  3.  4.8 1.  0. ]\nmixed.dtype: float64\n\n\nYou can cast an array to a different type using .astype. This will create a copy of the array with values cast to the type you specified. For example:\n\nmixedint = mixed.astype(int)  # cast to int\nprint(\"mixedint:\", mixedint)\nprint(\"mixedint.dtype:\", mixedint.dtype)  # everything cast to int\n\nmixedint: [1 2 3 4 1 0]\nmixedint.dtype: int64",

    "section": "Array operations",
    "text": "Array operations\nOne of the most useful aspects about NumPy arrays is they allow you to perform mathematical operations on the all the elements in the list using the same syntax you would for single variables. For example, we can add all the values in one array to another by doing:\n\na = np.arange(1000000)\nb = np.arange(1000000)\nc = a + b  # add element-wise\nprint(\"c:\", c)\n\nc: [      0       2       4 ... 1999994 1999996 1999998]\n\n\nCompare that to the way we had to add two Python lists together above. Note that if a and b were Python lists a+b concatenates them together (i.e., appends the values of b on to the end of a) where as if a and b are Numpy arrays, the values are added together element-wise.\nAside from being easier to write, NumPy array operations are also much faster than Python operations. Let’s time how long it took to create c:\n\n%timeit c = a + b\n\n381 μs ± 20.5 μs per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1,000 loops each)\n\n\nCompare to what we got when we did the same thing with Python lists above. It’s about 100 times faster!\n\nMore advanced math operations\nNumpy comes with a large number of math functions built-in, which we can run on NumPy arrays. For example:\n\n# take the sine of every element in a:\nprint(np.sin(a))\n\n# sum up all the values in a:\nprint(np.sum(a))\n\n# take the average of all the values in a:\nprint(np.mean(a))\n\n[ 0.          0.84147098  0.90929743 ...  0.21429647 -0.70613761\n -0.97735203]\n499999500000\n499999.5\n\n\nSome operations can also be executed as methods on the array. For example:\n\n# sum up all the values in a:\nprint(a.sum())  \n\n# take the average of all the values in a:\nprint(a.mean())\n\n499999500000\n499999.5\n\n\nNote that this doesn’t work with the sine function, however:\n\na.sin()\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)\nCell In[33], line 1\n----&gt; 1 a.sin()\n\nAttributeError: 'numpy.ndarray' object has no attribute 'sin'\n\n\n\nIn VS Code, you can see all the operations you can call as methods of the array by typing the array name + .; e.g., a.. That will show a drop-down list that you can cycle through.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionCode Challenge 1.1\n\n\n\nLet’s illustrate the speed and simplicity of NumPy vs native Python lists.\n\nCreate a Python array that has 100,000 values equally spaced between 0 and 2*pi (pi = 3.141592653589793).\nCalculate the average of the cosine of every value in the Python array. For the cos function, you will need to import the math module.\nRepeat steps 1 and 2, but using purely NumPy arrays and functions. You should be able to do step 2 in a single line of code. Note that NumPy has an in-built pi value (np.pi).\nTime how long it takes the computer to do Step 2. Compare how long that takes when you use NumPy. When doing the comparison, just time the math operation step, not the array creation. Which is faster? Hint: for timing the Python version, you’ll need to use %%timeit rather than %timeit, as the Python version will require multiple lines of code. Put all the lines in a single cell in your notebook, and put %%timeit at the top to time the entire cell, rather than just a single line.\nWhich is computationally faster? By what factor?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCautionSolution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create the Python array:\n\n\nxsize = 100000\nx = [xi*2*np.pi/xsize for xi in range(xsize)]\n\n\nEvaluation:\n\n\nimport math\ny = [math.cos(xi) for xi in x]\nsum(y)/len(y)\n\n-3.8771274778262895e-17\n\n\n\nSame, with numpy:\n\n\nimport numpy as np\n# create the array\nx = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, xsize)\n# take the average of the cosine of the values\nnp.cos(x).mean()\n\nnp.float64(9.99999999994543e-06)\n\n\n\nPython timing, in a Jupyter cell:\n\n\n%%timeit\ny = [math.cos(xi) for xi in x]\nsum(y)/len(y)\n\nNumpy:\n\n%timeit np.cos(x).mean()\n\nYou should get that the numpy version is faster, by a factor of 10-100.",

    "section": "Concatenation",
    "text": "Concatenation\nConcatenation appends the rows of one or more dataframes together. This is a row-oriented operation so the resulting datafram will be longer. For example, if a 50-row dataframe is concatenated with a 40-row dataframe, you will have a 90-row dataframe.\nThe pd.concat() function is used to concatenate frames. It takes several arguments, but the most often-used ones are: pd.concat(items: list[pd.DataFrame], ignore_index=False). The first argument is a list of Dataframes to concat. The ignore_index keyword argument governs what happens to the indices in the combined frame: we can choose to keep the current index in each dataframe ignore_index=False or create a new index ignore_index=True.\nAn example:\n\nimport pandas as pd\ncampus_students = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mafudge/datasets/master/delimited/campus-students.csv\")\ncampus_students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nGrade\nYear\n\n\n\n\n0\nHelen\nNaN\nSophomore\n\n\n1\nIris\n10.0\nSenior\n\n\n2\nJimmy\n8.0\nFreshman\n\n\n3\nKaren\nNaN\nFreshman\n\n\n4\nLynne\n10.0\nSophomore\n\n\n5\nMike\n10.0\nSophomore\n\n\n6\nNico\nNaN\nJunior\n\n\n7\nPete\n8.0\nFreshman\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nonline_students = pd.read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mafudge/datasets/master/delimited/online-students.csv\")\nonline_students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nGrade\nYear\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n0\nAbby\n7.0\nFreshman\nNY\n\n\n1\nBob\n9.0\nSophomore\nCA\n\n\n2\nChris\n10.0\nSenior\nCA\n\n\n3\nDave\n8.0\nFreshman\nNY\n\n\n4\nEllen\n7.0\nSophomore\nTX\n\n\n5\nFran\n10.0\nSenior\nFL\n\n\n6\nGreg\n8.0\nFreshman\nNY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncombined_students = pd.concat([campus_students, online_students])\ncombined_students\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nGrade\nYear\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n0\nHelen\nNaN\nSophomore\nNaN\n\n\n1\nIris\n10.0\nSenior\nNaN\n\n\n2\nJimmy\n8.0\nFreshman\nNaN\n\n\n3\nKaren\nNaN\nFreshman\nNaN\n\n\n4\nLynne\n10.0\nSophomore\nNaN\n\n\n5\nMike\n10.0\nSophomore\nNaN\n\n\n6\nNico\nNaN\nJunior\nNaN\n\n\n7\nPete\n8.0\nFreshman\nNaN\n\n\n0\nAbby\n7.0\nFreshman\nNY\n\n\n1\nBob\n9.0\nSophomore\nCA\n\n\n2\nChris\n10.0\nSenior\nCA\n\n\n3\nDave\n8.0\nFreshman\nNY\n\n\n4\nEllen\n7.0\nSophomore\nTX\n\n\n5\nFran\n10.0\nSenior\nFL\n\n\n6\nGreg\n8.0\nFreshman\nNY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconcat() - Ignoring the index\nAs you can see from the code above the index from the original DataFrames was used. For example Helen and Abby both share the index 0. This means that if you provide index 0, you’ll get both of them, e.g.:\n\ncombined_students['Name'][0]\n\n0    Helen\n0     Abby\nName: Name, dtype: object\n\n\nWhile this is acceptable, there are situations where a new index based on combined values is desirable. We will encounter this later when grouping or pivioting data.\nTo make this happen include the ignore_index=True named argument. This will create a new index from the output DataFrame.\n\nstudents = pd.concat([campus_students, online_students], ignore_index=True)\nstudents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nGrade\nYear\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n0\nHelen\nNaN\nSophomore\nNaN\n\n\n1\nIris\n10.0\nSenior\nNaN\n\n\n2\nJimmy\n8.0\nFreshman\nNaN\n\n\n3\nKaren\nNaN\nFreshman\nNaN\n\n\n4\nLynne\n10.0\nSophomore\nNaN\n\n\n5\nMike\n10.0\nSophomore\nNaN\n\n\n6\nNico\nNaN\nJunior\nNaN\n\n\n7\nPete\n8.0\nFreshman\nNaN\n\n\n8\nAbby\n7.0\nFreshman\nNY\n\n\n9\nBob\n9.0\nSophomore\nCA\n\n\n10\nChris\n10.0\nSenior\nCA\n\n\n11\nDave\n8.0\nFreshman\nNY\n\n\n12\nEllen\n7.0\nSophomore\nTX\n\n\n13\nFran\n10.0\nSenior\nFL\n\n\n14\nGreg\n8.0\nFreshman\nNY\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBest practice - data lineage\nWhen combining datasets, its a really good idea to retain data lineage, or a record of where the data came from.

If your ist356 environment is not active, activate it by running conda activate ist356.\nNow run:\npython -m streamlit run hello-ui.py\nWhen you run the script, Streamlit launches a webserver on your computer to run your app; your default web browser will automatically open with the simple website Streamlit created.\nIf you edit the hello-ui.py file, streamlit will automatically detect the changes when the changes are saved. If you re-do the interaction (in this case, adding a name and hitting Enter), the new code will be executed. Try it! Add a waving emoji by adding :wave: before the Hello in the st.write.\nThe app will continue to run in the browser.

Good for commands you want every interactive shell to run (e.g., aliases, functions).\n\nOn many systems, .bash_profile will call .bashrc so settings apply in both contexts.\n\nTip: If unsure where to put something, put it in .bashrc and make sure .bash_profile sources .bashrc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteUsing Zsh?\n\n\n\nIf your default shell is zsh (common on macOS Catalina and later), the equivalent files are: - ~/.zprofile – similar to .bash_profile - ~/.zshrc – similar to .bashrc\nConfiguration changes should go into ~/.zshrc for most use cases.\n\n\nYou can put any bash command you like in these scripts to further customize your shell.
